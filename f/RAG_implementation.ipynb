Introduction to Biology eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Science is the study in which observations are made,experiments are done and logical conclusions \\nare drawn in order to understand the principles of nature.\\nIn ancient times, the scientific information was not classified into different branches, as it exists \\ntoday. All the scientific information was included under one head i.e. ‘science’. With the passage of time scientific information increased many folds and this enormous scientific knowledge was then classified into different branches like, biology, physics, chemistry, mathematics etc.\\n1.1 Introduction To Biology\\nBiology is the scientific study of life. The word “biology” has been derived from two Greek words; ‘bios’ meaning ‘life’ and ‘logos’ meaning ‘thought or reasoning’. In the course of biology, we will study how man has thought about living things. To understand and appreciate nature, it is essential to study the structures, functions and related aspects of living organisms. The study of living organisms also provides information and remedies to human problems regarding health, food, environment etc.Scientific knowledge is the common heritage of mankind.\\nDr. Abdus Salam\\nAnimation 1.1: Microscope\\nSource & Credit: savillbiology3\\n1. Introduction to Biology eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.11.1.1 Divisions and Branches of Biology  \\nThere are three major divisions of biology which study the different aspects of the lives of the \\nmajor groups of organisms.\\nZOOLOGY\\nThis division of biology deals with the study of animals.\\nBOTANY\\nThis division of biology deals with the study of plants.\\nMICROBIOLOGY\\nThis division of biology deals with the study of microorganisms such as bacteria etc. In order to study all the aspects of life, these divisions are further divided into different branches as defined below.\\nMorphology\\nThis branch deals with the study of form and structures of living organisms.\\nMolecular biology (biochemistry) deals with the study of the molecules of life; e.g. water, \\nproteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids.\\nAnatomy\\nThe study of internal structures is called anatomy.\\nHistology\\nThe microscopic study of tissues is called histology.\\nCell biology\\nThe study of the structures and functions of cells and cell organelles is called cell biology. This branch also deals with the study of cell division.\\nPhysiology\\nThis branch deals with the study of the functions of different parts of living organisms.4\\n1. Introduction to Biology eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Genetics\\nThe study of genes and their roles in inheritance is called genetics. Inheritance means the \\ntransmission of characters from one generation to the other.\\nEmbryology\\nIt is the study of the development of an embryo to new individual.\\nTaxonomy\\nIt is the study of the naming and classification of organisms into groups and subgroups.\\nPalaeontology\\nIt is the study of fossils, which are the remains of extinct organisms.\\nEnvironmental biology\\nIt deals with the study of the interactions between the organisms and their environment.\\nSocio-biology\\nThis branch deals with the study of social behaviour of the animals that make societies.\\nParasitology: \\nThis branch deals with the study of parasites.\\nBiotechnology:\\nIt deals with the practical application of living organisms to make substances for the welfare of mankind.\\nImmunology\\nIt is the study of the immune system of animals, which defends the body against invading microbes.\\nEntomology\\nIt is the study of insects.Parasites are the organisms that take food and shelter from living hosts and, in return, \\nharm them.5\\n1. Introduction to Biology eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Pharmacology\\nIt is the study of drugs and their effects on the systems of human body.\\n1.1.2 Relationship of biology to other sciences      \\nThe interrelationship among different branches of science cannot be denied. Biology includes \\ninformation on various aspects of living things but these information relate to the other branches of science as well. Each branch of science has relationship with all other branches. For example, when studying the process of movement in animals, the biologists have to refer to the laws of motion in physics. This forms the basis of interdisciplinary sciences  (Figure 1.1).\\nBiophysics:\\nIt deals with the study of the principles of physics, which are applicable to biological phenomena. For example there is a similarity between the working principles of lever in physics and limbs of animals in biology.\\nBiochemistry: \\nIt deals with the study of the chemistry of different compounds and processes occurring in living organisms. For example the study of basic metabolism of photosynthesis and respiration involves the knowledge of chemistry.\\nBiomathematics / Biometry: \\nIt deals with the study of biological processes using mathematical techniques and tools. For example to analyze the data gathered after experimental work, biologists have to apply the rules of mathematics.Discussion / Debate\\nIdentify and evaluate the impact of scientific ideas and/or advancements in technology on society.Human population growth, infectious diseases, addictive drugs and pollution are the major biological issues today.6\\n1. Introduction to Biology eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Biogeography: \\nIt deals with study of the occurrence and distribution of different species of living organisms in \\ndifferent geographical regions of the world. It applies the knowledge of the characteristics of particular geographical regions to determine the characteristics of living organisms found there.\\nBioeconomics:\\nIt deals with the study of organisms from economical point of view. For example the cost value and profit value of the yield of wheat can be calculated through bioeconomics and benefits or losses can be determined.\\n1.1.3 Careers In Biology    \\nIt is essential that students of today, who will occupy positions of leadership tomorrow, have the background of the modern and forward-looking branches of science. An accurate and modern knowledge of biology, will promote a comprehension of both science and scientific research projects. It will benefit the learners in diverse list of careers. The following are the careers that a student of biology can plan to adopt.\\nMedicine / Surgery: \\nThe profession of medicine deals with the diagnosis and treatment of diseases in human. In surgery the parts of the body may be repaired, replaced or removed, for example the removal of stones through renal surgery, transplantation of kidney, liver etc. Both these professions are studied in the same basic course (MBBS) and then students go for specializations. Figure 1.1: Relationship of biology with other sciences\\nDiscussion / Debate\\nIdentify and evaluate the impact of scientific ideas and/or advancements in technology on society7\\n1. Introduction to Biology eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Fisheries: \\nFisheries is the professional study of fish production. There are departments in Pakistan where \\nprofessionals of fisheries are employed. They serve for enhancing the quality and quantity of fish production. In Pakistan, this profession can be adopted after the bachelor or masters level study of zoology and fisheries.\\nAgriculture:\\nThis profession deals with the food crops and animals which are the source of food. An agriculturist works for the betterment of crops like wheat, rice, corn etc and animals like buffalo cow etc from which we get food. In Pakistan there are many universities which offer professional courses on agriculture after the higher secondary education in biology.\\nAnimal husbandry:\\nIt is the branch of agriculture concerned with the care and breeding of domestic animals (livestock) e.g. cattle, sheep etc. Professional courses in animal husbandry can be adopted after the higher secondary education in biology.\\nHorticulture: \\nIt deals with the art of gardening. A horticulturist works for the betterment of existing varieties and for the production of new varieties of ornamental plants and fruit plants. Biology students can adopt this profession after their higher secondary education.\\nFarming:\\nIt deals with the development and maintenance of different types of farm. For example in some farms animal breeding technologies are used for the production of animals which are better protein and milk source. In poultry farms chicken and eggs are produced. Similarly in fruit farms, different fruit yielding plants are grown. A student who has gone through the professional course of agriculture, animal husbandry or fisheries etc. can adopt this profession.\\nForestry: \\nIn forestry, professionals look after natural forests and advises to the government for planting and growing artificial forests. Many universities offer professional courses in forestry after the higher secondary education in biology or after bachelor level study of zoology and botany.8\\n1. Introduction to Biology eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Biotechnology:\\nIt is the latest profession in the field of biology. Biotechnologists study and work for the production \\nof useful products through microorganisms. Universities offer courses in biotechnology after the higher secondary education in biology and after the bachelor level studies of botany or zoology.\\n1.1.4 Quran and biology         \\nAt many places in Holy Quran, Allah hints about the origin and characteristics of living organisms. In the same verses human beings have been instructed to expose the unknown aspects of life, after getting the hints. Here are few examples of such guidelines.\\n“We made every living thing from water.”\\n          (Sura: Ambia, Verse: 30)\\nWe know that water makes the 60-70% of the composition of protoplasm of all living things. The above Verse hints at the common origin of all living things in water. As Allah has ordered human beings to think at the hints given by Him, we should study living things so that the mysteries of their origin can be revealed.\\n“He made man from clay like the potter.”  \\n        (Sura: Rehman, Verse: 14)\\nIn another verse, God says:\\n9\\n1. Introduction to Biology eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1“Then fashioned We the drop a clot, then fashioned We the clot a little lump, then \\nfashioned We the little lump bones, then clotted the bones with flesh”\\n    (Sura: Al-Mominoon, Verse: 14)\\nWhen we think at the hints given in both these Verses, we find the events that occurred in the \\ncreation of human beings. Allah also hints at the method of the development of animals including human beings.\\n“Allah hath created every animal from water. Then some of them creep up over their \\nbellies, others walk on two legs, and others on four. Allah creates what He pleases.”\\n (Sura: Al-Nur, Verse: 45)\\nThis Verse describes the common origin and modification of organisms and also supports the modern concepts of classification.Thus, Quran hints not only at the origin and development of life but also at many characteristics of living organisms.\\n1.2 Muslim Scientists\\nMuslim scientists have made great contributions to the study of science and we are aware of their success in different fields of science. Here we would summarize the work of Jabir Bin Hayan, Abdul Malik Asmai and Bu Ali Sina in the development of the present day knowledge of plants and animals.\\nJabir Bin Hayan (721 - 815 AD): \\nHe was born in Iran and practised medicine in Iraq. He introduced experimental investigation in chemistry and also wrote a number of books on plants and animals. His famous books are “Al-Nabatat” and “Al-Haywan”.\\nAbdul Malik Asmai (740 - 828 AD):  \\nHe is considered the first Muslim scientist who studied animals in detail. His famous writings include “Al-Abil (camel)”, “Al-Khail (horse)”, “Al-Wahoosh (animal)”, and “Kalq al-Ansan”.10\\n1. Introduction to Biology eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Bu Ali Sina (980 - 1037 AD):\\nHe is honoured as the founder of medicine and called as Avicenna in the West. He was a physician, \\nphilosopher, astronomer and poet. One of his books “Al-Qanun-fi al-Tib” is known as the canon of medicine in West.\\nBu Ali Sina Jabir Bin Hyan\\n1.3 The Levels Of Organization       \\nIn order to understand the various phenomena of life, biologists study biological organization at different levels, which are as follows.\\n1. Subatomic and Atomic level\\nAll types of matter are made up of elements and each element contains a single kind of atoms (‘a’: not, ‘tom’: cut). The atoms are actually made up of many subatomic particles.The most stable subatomic particles are electrons, protons and neutrons. Out of the 92 kinds of elements that occur in nature, 16 are called bioelements. These take part in making the body mass of a living organism (Figure 1.2). Out of these bioelements; Only six (O, C, H, N, Ca, & P) make 99% of the total mass.  Other ten (K, S, Cl, Na, Mg, Fe, Cu, Mn, Zn, & I) collectively make    01%  of the total mass.\\nRecalling\\nProtons and neutrons are located inside nucleus of atom while electrons orbit in energy levels (electrons shells) around the nucleus. The number of electrons in the outermost shell determines the manner in which atoms react with each other.11\\n1. Introduction to Biology eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Figure 1.2: Percentage composition (by mass) of bioelements in the protoplasm of living organisms\\n2. Molecular level\\nIn organisms, bioelements usually do not occur in isolated forms rather they combine through \\nionic or covalent bonding. The stable particle formed by such bonding is called as molecule or biomolecule.\\nAn organism is formed by enormous number of biomolecules of hundreds of different types. \\nThese molecules are the building material and are themselves constructed in great variety and complexity due to specific bonding arrangements. Biomolecules are classified as micromolecules and macromolecules. Micromolecules are with low molecular weight e.g. glucose, water etc. and \\nmacromolecules  are with high molecular weights e.g. starch, proteins, lipids etc.Recalling\\nA molecule is the smallest part of a compound that retains the properties of that compound.\\n12\\n1. Introduction to Biology eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.13. Organelle and Cell level\\nBiomolecules assemble in a particular way and form organelles. The organelles are actually sub-\\ncellular structures and when they assemble together, units of life i.e. cells are formed.  \\nEach type of organelle is specialized to perform a specific function. For example; mitochondria \\nare specialized for cellular respiration and ribosomes are specialized for protein synthesis. In this way, functions of the cell are accomplished by these specialized structures. It is an example of the division of labour within the cell. \\nIn the case of prokaryotes and most protists, the entire organism consists of a single cell. In the \\ncase of most fungi, all animals and all plants, the organism consists of up to trillions of cells.\\n4. Tissue level\\nIn multicellular organisms, similar cells (performing similar functions) are organized into groups, called tissues. We can define a tissue as a group of similar cells specialized for the performance of a common function. Each cell in a tissue carries on its own life processes (like cellular respiration, protein synthesis), but it also carries on some special processes related to the function of the tissue. There are different types of plant tissues e.g. epidermal tissue, ground tissue, etc. Animal tissues are also of different types e.g. nervous tissue, muscular tissues etc.\\n5. Organ and Organ system level\\nIn higher multicellular organisms more than one type of tissue having related functions are organized together and make a unit, called organ. Different tissues of an organ perform their specific functions and these functions collectively become the function/s of that organ. For example stomach is an organ specialized for the digestion of proteins and for storing food. Two major types of tissue are present in its structure. Epithelial (glandular) tissue secretes gastric juice for the digestion of proteins.\\nMuscular tissue performs contractions of stomach walls for grinding of food and moving food \\nto posterior end. So two tissues perform their specific functions, which collectively become the function of stomach.\\nThe next level of organization in multicellular organisms is the organ system level. Different organs \\nperforming related functions are organized together in the form of an organ system. In an organ system, each organ carries out its specific function and the functions of all organs appear as the function of the organ system. For example, digestive system is an organ system that carries out the 13\\n1. Introduction to Biology eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1process of digestion. Major organs in its framework are oral cavity, stomach, small intestine, large \\nintestine, liver, and pancreas. All these organs help in the process of digestion.\\nThe organ system level is less complex in plants (e.g. root system) as compared to animals. This is \\ndue to a greater range of functions and activities in animals than in plants.\\n6. Individual level\\nDifferent organs and organ systems are organized together to form an individual or organism. In organism, the functions, processes and activities of various organs and organ systems are coordinated. For example, when a man is engaged in continuous and hard exercise, not only his muscles are working but also there is an increase in the rate of respiration and heart beat. This accelerated rate of respiration and heart beat supplies more oxygen and food to the muscles which they need for continuous work.\\n7. Population level\\nBiologists extend their studies to the population level where they study interactions among member of the same species living in the same habitat. A population is defined as a group of organisms of the same species located at the same place, in the same time. For example, human population in Pakistan in 2010 comprises of 173.5 million individuals (according to the Ministry of Population Welfare, Government of Pakistan).\\nHabitat means the area of the environment in which organism lives.A species is defined as a group of organisms capable of interbreeding and producing fertile \\noffspring.14\\n1. Introduction to Biology eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.18. Community Level\\nA community is an assemblage of different populations, interacting with one another within \\nthe same environment. A forest may be considered as a community. It includes different plant, microorganisms, fungi and animal species. Communities are collections of organisms, in which one population may increase and others may decrease. Some communities are complex e.g. a forest community, a pond community etc. Other communities may be simple e.g. a fallen log with various populations under it. In a simple community number and size of populations is limited. So any change in biotic or abiotic factors may have drastic and long lasting effects.\\n9. Biosphere level\\nThe part of the Earth inhabited by organisms’ communities is known as biosphere. It constitutes all ecosystems (areas where living organisms interact with the nonliving components of the environment) and is also called the zone of life on Earth.\\n1.3.1 Cellular organizations   \\nAll the organisms have been divided into five major groups i.e. prokaryotes, protists, fungi, plants and animals. All organisms are made of cells. There are two basic types of cells. The organisms in first group are made of prokaryotic cells while all other groups have eukaryotic cells.\\nCells organize in three ways to make the bodies of organisms. Cells make unicellular, colonials and \\nmulticellular organizations and the organisms formed through these organizations are unicellular organisms, colonial organisms and multicellular organisms.\\nIn unicellular organisms, only one cell makes the life of an organism. All the life activities are \\ncarried out by the only cell. Amoeba, Paramecium, and Euglena are common examples (Figure 1.4).15\\n1. Introduction to Biology eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1\\nFigure 1.3: Levels of organization16\\n1. Introduction to Biology eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1\\nFigure 1.4: Amoeba, Paramecium and Euglena\\nIn colonial type of cellular organization, many unicellular \\norganisms live together but do not have any division of labour among them. Each unicellular organism in a colony lives its own life and does not depend on other cells for its vital requirements. Volvox is a green alga found in water that shows colonial organization. Hundreds of Volvox cells make a colony (Figure 1.5).\\nIn multicellular organization , cells are organized in \\nthe form of tissues, organs and organ systems. Frog \\nand mustard are the familiar examples of multicellular organization.\\nFigure 1.5: Volvox colony\\nMustard plant\\nMustard plant (scientific name: Brassica campestris ) is sown in winter and it produces seeds at the \\nend of winter. The plant body is used as vegetable and its seeds are used for extracting oil. The organs of the body can be divided into two groups on the basis of their functions. Root, stem, branches and leaves are the vegetative organs, which do not take part in the sexual reproduction of the plant. Flowers are the reproductive parts of the plant because they take part in sexual reproduction and produce fruits and seeds. (Figure 1.6)17\\n1.

Solving a Biological Problem eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Science is the systemized knowledge derived from observations and experiments.These experiments \\nare carried out to determine the principles about how nature operates. Scientists like chemists, biologists and physicists use the same scientific method to make and test new theories.\\nIn this chapter, we will study the steps of biological method. We will study malaria as an example \\nto understand the steps in detail.\\n2.1 Biological Method\\nQuestions about living things have provided problems that man has investigated to aid his own survival and to satisfy his desire to know. The scientific method in which biological problems are solved, is termed as biological method. It comprises the steps a biologist adopts in order to solve a biological problem. \\nBiological method has played an important \\npart in scientific research for almost 500 years. From Galileo’s experiment (in the 1590s) to current research, the biological method has contributed to the advancements in medicine, ecology, technology etc. Biological method also ensures the quality of data for public use\\n2.1.1 Biological problem, hypothesis, deductions and experiments\\nIn biology (like other sciences), new things are being discovered and long-held theories are being modified or replaced with better ones as more data/knowledge is accumulated. This happens when biologists recognize some biological problem and go for its solution. In solving a biological problem, biologist takes following steps;•\\n Recognition of biological problem\\n•\\n Observations\\n•\\n Hypothesis formulation\\n•\\n DeductionsMan has always been a biologist. He had to be a biologist in order to live. Early in history, he was a hunter of animals and a gatherer of fruits, seeds, roots etc. The more he knew about animals and their habitat, the more successful hunter he was. The more he knew about plants, the better he distinguished between edible and non-edible plants.3\\n2. Solving a Biological Problem eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1• Experimentation\\n•\\n Summarization of results (create tables, graphics etc)\\n•\\n Reporting the results\\nTh\\ne details of these steps are as under:\\n1. Recognition of the Biological Problem\\nBiologists go for adopting biological method when they encounter some biological problem. A \\nbiological problem is a question related to living organisms that is either asked by some one or comes in biologist’s mind by himself.\\n2. Observations\\nAs the first step in solving a biological problem, biologist recalls his/her previous observations or makes new ones. Observations are made with five senses of vision, hearing, smell, taste and touch. Observations may be both qualitative and quantitative. Quantitative observations are considered more accurate than qualitative ones because the former are invariable and measurable and can be recorded in terms of numbers. Examples of qualitative and quantitative observations are given below.\\nQualitative observations Quantitative observations\\n•\\n The freezing point of water  is colder than the boiling point.\\n•\\n A liter of water is heavier than a liter of ethanol.• \\n The freezing point of water  0 oC and the \\nboiling point is 100 oC.\\n•\\n A liter of water weighs \\n1000 grams and a liter \\nof ethanol weighs 789 grams.\\nObservations also include reading and studying what others have done in the past because scientific knowledge is ever-growing.\\nBiologists can’t usually check every situation where a hypothesis might apply. Let’s consider a hypothesis:“All plant cells have a nucleus”. Biologist cannot examine every living plant and every plant that has ever lived to see if this hypothesis is false. Instead, biologists generate deduction using reasoning. From the above hypothesis, a biologist can make the following deduction: “If  examine cells from a blade of grass, then each one will have a nucleus”.4\\n2. Solving a Biological Problem eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.13. Formulation of Hypotheses\\nObservations do not become scientific observations until they are organized and related to a \\nquestion.Biologist organizes his/her and others’ observations into data form and constructs a statement that may prove to be the answer of the biological problem under study. This tentative explanation of observations is called a hypothesis. It may be defined as a proposition that might be true. A hypothesis should have the following characteristics:•\\n It should be a general statement.\\n•\\n It should be a tentative idea.\\n•\\n It should agree with available observations.\\n•\\n It should be kept as simple as possible.\\n•\\n It \\nshould be testable and potentially falsifiable. In other words, there should be a way to show \\nthe hypothesis is false; a way to disprove the hypothesis.\\nA great deal of careful and creative thinking is necessary for the formulation of a hypothesis. Biologists use reasoning to formulate a hypothesis.\\n4. Deductions\\nIn the next step, biologist draws deductions from hypotheses. Deductions are the logical consequences of hypotheses. For this purpose, a hypothesis is taken as true and expected results (deductions) are drawn from it.Generally in biological method, if a particular hypothesis is true then one should expect (deduction) a certain result. This involves the use of “if-then” logic.\\n5. Experimentation\\nThe most basic step of biological method is experimentation. Biologist performs experiments to see if hypotheses are true or not. The deductions, which are drawn from hypotheses, are subjected to rigorous testing. Through experimentations, biologist learns which hypothesis is correct. The incorrect hypotheses are rejected and the one which proves correct is accepted. An accepted hypothesis makes further predictions that provide an important way to further test its validity.\\n6. Summarization of results\\nBiologist gathers actual, quantitative data from experiments. Data for each of the groups are then averaged and compared statistically. To draw conclusions, biologist also uses statistical analysis.5\\n2. Solving a Biological Problem eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.17. Reporting the results\\nBiologists publish their findings in scientific journals and books, in talks at national and international \\nmeetings and in seminars at colleges and universities. Publishing of results is an essential part of scientific method. It allows other people to verify the results or apply the knowledge to solve other problems.What is “Control” in experiments?\\nIn science when doing the experiment, it must be a controlled experiment. The scientist must contrast an “experimental group” with a “control group”. The two groups are treated exactly alike except for the one variable being tested. For example, in an experiment to test the necessity of carbon dioxide for photosynthesis, one can contrast the control group (a plant with freely available carbon dioxide) with an experimental group (a plant with no carbon dioxide available). The necessity of carbon dioxide will be proved when photosynthesis occurs in the control group and does not occur in the experimental group.\\nStudy Of Malaria - An Example Of Biological Method  \\nWe know malaria is a common disease in many countries including Pakistan. We will go through the history of this disease to know how biology solved the biological problem concerning the cause and transmission of malaria. In ancient times (more than 2000 years ago), physicians were familiar with malaria. They described it as a disease of chills and fevers with recurring attacks. They also observed that the disease was more common among people living in low, marshy areas. It was thought that the stagnant water of marshes poisoned the air and as a result of breathing in this “bad air”, people got malaria. This belief led to the name of this disease. The Italian words “mala” means bad and “aria” means air. For further clarification of the observation, some volunteers \\ndrank stagnant water from the marshes. They did not develop malaria.In the 17th century when the New World (America) was discovered, many plants from America were sent back to Europe to be used as medicines. The bark of a tree known as quina-quina  was very \\nsuitable for curing fevers. It was so beneficial that soon it was impossible to carry enough bark to Europe. Some dishonest merchants began to substitute the bark of another tree, cinchona  which \\nclosely resembled quina-quina. This dishonesty proved much valuable for mankind. Cinchona bark was found to be excellent for treating malaria. We now know the reason: cinchona bark contains quinine  that is effective in treating the disease6\\n2. Solving a Biological Problem eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1At that time, physicians treated malaria with cinchona without understanding the cause of malaria. \\nTwo hundred years later, it was found that some diseases are caused by tiny living organisms. After this discovery, it also became a belief that malaria, too, might be caused by some microorganism. In 1878, a French army physician Laveran began to search for the “cause” of malaria. He took a \\nsmall amount of blood from a malarial patient and examined it under microscope. He noticed some tiny living creatures. His discovery was not believed by other scientists. Two years later, another physician saw the same creatures in the blood of another malarial patient. Three years after the second discovery, the same creatures were observed for third time. The organism was given a name Plasmodium. \\nIn the last part of nineteenth century, many different causes of malaria were being suggested. By \\nthat time, there were four major observations about malaria.\\n•\\n Malaria and marshy areas have some relation.\\n•\\n Quinine is an effective drug for treating malaria.\\n•\\n Drinking the water of marshes does not cause malaria.\\n•\\n Plasmodium is seen in the blood of malarial patients.\\nWe know \\nthat a scientist uses whatever information and observation he has and makes one or \\nmore hypotheses. The hypothesis made in this case was; \\n                         “Plasmodium is the cause of malaria.” \\nScientist does not know whether his hypothesis is true or not, but he accepts it may be true and makes deductions. One of the deductions from the above hypothesis was; \\n“If Plasmodium is the cause of malaria, then all person ill with malaria should                                     \\n                              have Plasmodium in their blood. ”\\nThe next step was to test the deduction through experiments which were designed as;\\n“Blood of 100 malarial patients was examined under microscope. For the purpose of having a \\ncontrol group, the blood of 100 healthy persons was also examined under microscope.”\\nThe results of experiments showed that almost all malarial patients had Plasmodium in their blood while 07 out of 100 healthy persons also had Plasmodium in their blood (now we know that Plasmodium in the blood of healthy people was in incubation period i.e. the period between the entry of parasite in host and the appearance of symptoms). The results were quite convincing and proved that the hypothesis “Plasmodium is the cause of malaria” was true.\\nMalaria has killed more people than any other disease. The account of malaria is an example of a biological problem and of how such problems are solved.7\\n2. Solving a Biological Problem eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Next biological problem was to learn about “How Plasmodium gets into the blood of man”. Biologists \\nwere having following observations;\\n•\\n Malaria is associated with marshes.\\n•\\n Drinking water of marshes does not cause malaria.\\n•\\n \\nFrom these \\nobservations, it can be concluded that Plasmodium was not in the marsh water. But it \\nmust be carried by something that comes to marsh water. In 1883, a physician A. F. A. King, listed \\n20 observations. Some important observations of King were:•\\n People who slept outdoors were more likely to get malaria than those who slept indoors;\\n•\\n People \\nwho slept under fine nets were less likely to get malaria than those who did not use such \\nnets; and\\n•\\n Individuals who slept near a smoky fire usually did not get malaria.\\n•\\n \\nOn the basis of these observations King suggested a hypothesis:\\n \\n“Mosquitoes transmit Plasmodium and so are involved in the spread of malaria.”\\nFollowing deductions were made considering the hypothesis as true i.e. If mosquitoes are involved in the spread of malaria then;\\n                     “Plasmodium should be present in mosquitoes.”\\n           “A mosquito can get Plasmodium by biting a malarial patient.”In order to test the above deductions, Ronald Ross: a British army physician working in India in 1880’s; performed important experiments. He allowed a female Anopheles mosquito to bite a malarial patient. He killed the mosquito some days later and found Plasmodium multiplying in mosquito’s stomach.\\nThe next logical experiment was to allow an infected mosquito (having Plasmodium) to bite a healthy person. If hypothesis was true, the healthy person would have got malaria. But scientists avoid using human beings for experiments when results can be so serious. Ross used sparrows and redesigned his experiments. He allowed a female Culex mosquito to bite on the sparrows suffering \\nfrom malaria. Some of the mosquitoes were killed and studied at various times. Ross found that Plasmodium multiplied in the wall of mosquito’s stomach and then moved into mosquito’s salivary glands. He kept some mosquitoes alive and allowed them to bite healthy sparrows. Ross found that the saliva of the infected mosquito contained Plasmodia (plural of Plasmodium) and these entered the sparrow’s blood. When he examined the blood of these previously healthy sparrows, he found many Plasmodia in it. In fact quinine was the  only effective remedy for malaria from the 17th to the 20th century.8\\n2. Solving a Biological Problem eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Figure 2.1 : Malaria in sparrow and man is transmitted by Culex and \\nAnopheles mosquitoes respectively\\nIn the end, the hypothesis was tested by direct experimentation on human beings. In 1898, Italian \\nbiologists allowed an Anopheles  mosquito to bite a malarial patient. The mosquito was kept for a \\nfew days and then it was allowed to bite a healthy man. This person later became ill with malaria. In this way, it was confirmed that mosquitoes transmit Plasmodium and spread malaria. (Figure 2.1)\\n2.1.2 Theory, law and principle\\nWhen a hypothesis is given a repeated exposure to experimentation and is not falsified, it increases biologists’ confidence in hypothesis. Such well-supported hypothesis may be used as the basis for formulating further hypotheses which are again proved by experimental results. The hypotheses that stand the test of time (often tested and never rejected), are called theories. A theory is \\nsupported by a great deal of evidence.\\nProductive theory keeps on suggesting new hypotheses and so testing goes on. Many biologists \\ntake it as a challenge and exert greater efforts to disprove the theory. If a theory survives such doubtful approach and continues to be supported by experimental evidence, it becomes a law orWhile testing the hypothesis that plasmodium is the cause of malaria, what would be the control group of the experiment? Blood of malarial patients or blood of healthy persons?Blood of healthy persons9\\n2. Solving a Biological Problem eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1principle. A scientific law is a uniform or constant fact of nature. It is an irrefutable theory. Examples \\nof biological laws are Hardy-Weinberg law and Mendel’s laws of inheritance.\\nWhen a female mosquito pierces the skin with her mouthparts, she injects a small amount of saliva into the wound before drawing blood. The saliva prevents the blood from clotting in her food canal.\\nFigure 2.2: Biological method\\nFemale mosquitoes need the blood of mammals or birds for the maturation of their eggs.10\\n2. Solving a Biological Problem eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.12.2 Data Organization And Data Analysis\\nData organization and data analysis are important steps in biological method. Data can be defined \\nas the information such as names, dates or values made from observations and experimentation.\\nData organization\\nIn order to formulate and then to test hypotheses, scientists collect and organize data. Prior to conducting an experiment, it is very important for a scientist to describe data collection methods. It ensures the quality of experiment. Data is organized in different formats like graphics, tables, flow charts, maps and diagrams.\\nData analysis\\nData analysis is necessary to prove or disprove a hypothesis by experimentation. It is done through the application of statistical methods i.e. ratio and proportion. When a relation between two numbers e.g. ‘a’ and ‘b’ is expressed in terms of quotient (a/b), it is called the ratio of one number to the other. Ratio may be expressed by putting a division (÷) or colon (:) mark between the two numbers. For example the ratio between 50 malarial patients and 150 normal persons is 1:3.\\nProportion means to join two equal ratios by the sign of equality (=). For example; a:b = c:d is a \\nproportion between the two ratios. This proportion may also be expressed as a:b::c:d. When three values in a proportion are known, the fourth one (X) can be calculated.\\nFor example, a biologist can calculate how many birds will get malaria when he allows infected \\nmosquitoes to bite 100 healthy sparrows. In the previous experiment he noted that when he allowed mosquitoes to bite 20 sparrows, 14 out of them got malaria. Now he uses the proportion rule.The welts that appear after the mosquito leaves is not a reaction to the wound but an allergic \\nreaction to the saliva. In most cases, the itching sensation and swellings subside within several \\nhours.11\\n2. Solving a Biological Problem eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Statistics are thus a means of summarizing data through the calculation of mean value. This step \\nis very important as it transforms raw data into information, which can be used to summarize and report results\\n2.3 Mathematics: As An Integral Part Of Scientific Process\\nBiological method also involves the use of applied mathematics to solve biological problems.

Biodiversity eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1At least 10 million kinds of organisms inhabit the Earth but less than one third of these have been \\nstudied and catalogued (put in record) by biologists. Diversity among the Earth’s organisms is more obvious than the fundamental unity of life. We see that all organisms share many biological characteristics. Five principal groups of organisms are prokaryotes, protists, fungi, plants, and animals. In this chapter we will focus on the differences among different groups of organisms. We will also see how are organisms classified and named and what are the concerns with the existence of biodiversity.\\n3.1 Biodiversity\\nThe term “biodiversity” has been derived from ‘bio’ and ‘diversity’. “Diversity” means variety within a species and among species. Biodiversity is a measure of the variety of organisms present in different ecosystems.\\nThe diversity of plants’ (flora) and animals’ (fauna) in a region depends on climate, altitude, soils \\nand the presence of other species. Biodiversity is not distributed evenly on Earth. It is richest in the tropics. Temperate regions also have many species while there are fewer species in the polar regions. Biodiversity found on Earth today is the result of 4 billion years of evolution. The origin of life is not well known to science, though limited evidence suggests that until 600 million years ago, all life consisted of bacteria and similar unicellular organisms.\\nImportance of biodiversity\\nBiodiversity provides food for humans. A significant proportion of drugs are derived, directly or indirectly, from biological sources. A wide range of industrial materials e.g. building materials, fibres, dyes, resins, gums, adhesives, rubber and oil are derived directly from plants.\\nBiodiversity plays important role in making and maintaining ecosystems. It plays a part in regulating \\nthe chemistry of our atmosphere and water supply. Biodiversity is directly involved in recycling nutrients and providing fertile soils.3\\n3. Biodiversity eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1\\n3.2 Classification - Aims And Principles \\n  \\nThere is a large collection of very dissimilar forms of organisms, found on Earth. Over 1.5 million \\ntypes of animals and over 0.5 million types of plants are known to biologists and these are only a small percentage of the total types estimated to live on Earth. They range in complexity from small and simple bacteria to large and complex human beings. Some of them live in sea, some on land; some walk, others fly, and still others are stationary. Each has its own way of life i.e. getting food, avoiding unfavourable environmental conditions, finding a place to live, and reproducing its kind. When there are so many diverse kinds of organisms, it becomes difficult to learn about the characteristics of each.\\nTo study such a large collection, biologists classify the organisms into groups and subgroups and \\nfor this task they require some system. Biological classification is a method by which biologists divide organisms into groups and subgroups.Figure 3.1: Variety of plant life in a tropical (left) and temperate (right) region4\\n3. Biodiversity eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1              Figure 3.2: Variety of animal life in polar regions\\nAims of Classification\\nThe branch of biology which deals with classification is called taxonomy and the branch which deals \\nwith classification and also traces the evolutionary history of organisms is known as systematics. \\nThe main aims of both these branches are;\\n•\\n To \\ndetermine similarities and differences among organisms so that they can be studied easily.\\n•\\n To find the evolutionary relationships among organisms.\\nBasis of Classification\\nClassification is based on relationship amongst organisms and such relationship is got through \\nsimilarities in characteristics. These similarities suggest that all organisms are related to one another at some point in their evolutionary histories. However, some organisms are more closely related than others. For example sparrows are more closely related to pigeons than to insects. It means that the former two have common evolutionary histories. When biologists classify organisms into groups and subgroups, the similarities are seen in external and internal structures and stages of development. Modern genetics provides another type of information to taxonomists. The similarities and differences in the DNA of two studied organisms can be used for getting idea about similarities and differences in their structures and functions.\\n5\\n3. Biodiversity eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Taxonomic Hierarchy\\nThe groups into which organisms are classified are known as taxonomic categories or taxa (singular \\n“taxon”). The taxa form a ladder, called taxonomic hierarchy. All organisms are divided into five kingdoms. So kingdom is the largest taxon. On the basis of similarities, each kingdom is further divided into smaller taxa in the following way:\\n•\\tPhylum (Division: for plants and fungi): A phylum is a group of related classes.\\n•\\tClass: A class is a group of related orders.\\n•\\tOrder: An order is a group of related families.\\n•\\tFamily: A family is a group of related genera.\\n•\\tGenus: A genus is a group of related species.\\n•\\tSpecies: A species consists of similar organisms.\\nMembers of lower taxon resemble one another more than do the members of a higher taxon. Table 3.1 illustrates the classifications of humans ( Homo sapiens ) and pea ( Pisum sativum). \\nTable 3.1: Simple classification of two organisms\\nTaxa Human Pea\\nKingdom Animalia Plantae\\nPhylum Chordata Magnoliophyta\\nClass Mammalia Magnoliopsida\\nOrder Primates Fabales\\nFamily Hominidae Fabaceae\\nGenus Homo Pisum\\nSpecies H. sapiens P. sativum\\nSpecies\\n\\t\\n-\\n\\t\\nThe\\n\\t\\nBasic\\n\\t\\nUnit\\n\\t\\nof\\n\\t\\nClassification\\nSpecies is the basic unit of classification. “A species is a group of organisms which can interbreed freely among them and produce fertile offspring, but are reproductively isolated from all other such groups in nature.” Each species possesses its own distinct structural, ecological and behavioural characteristics.6\\n3. Biodiversity eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1\\nFigure 3.3: Taxonomic hierarchy\\nIn the definition of species we must emphasize “in nature” because \\ntwo organisms related to two different but closely related species can cross-breed under artificial conditions. In such unnatural crosses they produce infertile offspring. For example, a cross between a male donkey and a female horse produces an infertile offspring i.e. mule (Figure 3.4).The criteria of interbreeding cannot be used for species recognition in organisms who reproduce asexually and do not interbreed with one another (for example many unicellular organisms).\\nUse internet and find the classification schemes of a fungus and a bacterium.7\\n3. Biodiversity eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.13.3 History Of Classification Systems\\nThe earliest known system of classification of organisms comes from the Greek philosopher \\nAristotle.  He classified all living organisms known at that time as either in the group ‘plantae’ or in \\n‘animalia’. In 700s, Abu-Usman\\n\\tUmer\\n\\tAljahiz\\n described the characteristics of 350 species of animals in his \\nbook. He wrote a lot about the life of ants. In 1172, Ibn\\n\\tRushd\\n\\t(Averroes)\\n\\ttranslated Aristotle’s \\nbook \\n“de Anima (On the Soul)” in Arabic. In the end of 15th century, many biologists had started \\nwork on classification methods e.g. \\nAndrea Caesalpino(1519-1603 AD)Divided plants into fifteen groups and called them “genera“.\\nJohn Ray(1627-1705 AD)Published important works on plants’ classification.\\nAugustus Rivinus(1652-1723 AD)Introduced the taxon of “order“.\\nTournefort(1656-1708 AD)Introduced the taxa of “class“ and “species“.\\nCarolus Linnaeus(1707-1778 AD)Grouped species according to similar physical characteristics.Figure 3.4: Infertile mule\\nCarolus Linnaeus divided nature into three kingdoms: mineral, vegetable and animal. Linnaeus used five ranks in classification: class, order, genus, species, and variety. Linnaeus is best known for his introduction of the method still used to formulate the scientific name of every species.\\n8\\n3. Biodiversity eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Biologists prefer such a system that can provide maximum information about the basic differences \\nand similarities among different organisms. According to earlier classification system, organisms were classified into two kingdoms but now taxonomists agree on five-kingdom classification system. We will see the basis of these classification systems and the drawbacks in the two-kingdom and three-kingdom classification systems.\\n3.3.1 Two-Kingdom Classification System\\nIt is the oldest system and classifies all organisms into two kingdoms i.e. Plantae and Animalia. According to it, all organisms that can prepare food from simple inorganic materials and thus can store energy, are autotrophs and are included in kingdom plantae. On the other hand, the organisms that cannot synthesize their food and depend on autotrophs or others are heterotrophs and are included in kingdom animalia. According to this system, bacteria, fungi and algae were included in kingdom plantae. \\nSome taxonomists found this system unworkable because; many unicellular organisms like Euglena \\nhave both plant-like (presence of chlorophyll) and animal-like (heterotrophic mode of nutrition in darkness and lack of cell wall) characters. So there should be a separate kingdom for such organisms. This system also ignores the difference between organisms having prokaryotic and those having eukaryotic cells.\\n3.3.2 Three-Kingdom Classification System\\nIn 1866, Ernst \\tHacke l solved the first objection and proposed a third kingdom i.e. protista to \\naccommodate euglena-like organisms. He also included bacteria in kingdom protista. In this system, fungi were still included in the kingdom plantae. \\nThis system did not clear the difference between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Some biologists \\ndisagreed about the position of fungi in kingdom plantae. Fungi resemble plants in many ways but are not autotrophs. They are special form of heterotrophs that get their food by absorption. They do not have cellulose in their cell walls rather possess chitin.9\\n3. Biodiversity eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.13.3.3 Five-Kingdom Classification System\\nIn 1937, E-Chatton  suggested the terms of, “Procariotique” to describe bacteria and “Eucariotique” \\nto describe animal and plant cells. In 1967, Robert\\n\\tWhittaker\\n introduced the five-kingdom \\nclassification system. This system is based on;\\n•\\n The \\nlevels of cellular organization i.e. prokaryotic, unicellular eukaryotic and multicellular \\neukaryotic\\n•\\n The principal modes of nutrition i.e. photosynthesis, absorption, and ingestion.\\nOn \\nthis basis, organisms are classified into five Kingdoms: monera, protista, fungi, plantae and \\nanimalia. \\nIn 1988, Margulis\\n\\tand\\n\\tSchwartz\\n modified the five-kingdom classification of Whittaker. They \\nconsidered genetics along with cellular organization and mode of nutrition in classification. They \\nclassified the organisms into the same five kingdoms as proposed by Whittaker.\\n3.4 The Five Kingdoms\\nThe general characteristics of the five kingdoms are as follows (See Table 3.2 also);1.\\tKingdom\\n\\tmonera:\\n It includes prokaryotic organisms i.e. they are made of prokaryotic cells. \\nMonerans are unicellular, although some types form chains, clusters, or colonies of cells. Prokaryotic cells are radically different from eukaryotic cells. Most are heterotrophic but some perform photosynthesis because they have chlorophyll in their cytoplasm. Within this kingdom, there are two different kinds of organisms i.e. bacteria and cyanobacteria.\\n2.\\tKingdom\\n\\tprotista:  It includes \\neukaryotic unicellular and simple multicellular organisms. There \\nare three main types of protists.•\\n Algae \\nare unicellular, colonial or simple multicellular. They resemble plant cells with cell walls \\nand chlorophyll in chloroplasts. Simple multicellular means that they do not have multicellular sex organs and do not form embryos during their life cycles.\\n•\\t Protozoans  resemble animals whose cells lack chlorophyll and cell walls.\\n•\\n Some protists are\\n\\t\\nfungi-like.10\\n3. Biodiversity eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.13. Kingdom fungi :It includes eukaryotic multicellular heterotrophs which are absorptive in their \\nnutritional mode e.g. mushrooms. Most fungi are decomposers. They live on organic material, \\nsecrete digestive enzymes and absorb small organic molecules formed by the digestion by enzymes.\\n4\\n.  Kingdom Plantae:  It includes eukaryotic multicellular autotrophs. Plants are autotrophic in  \\n     nutritional mode, making their own food by photosynthesis. They have multicellular sex organs      and form embryos during their life cycles. Mosses, ferns and flowering plants are included in this      kingdom.\\n5. Kingdom Animalia:  It includes eukaryotic multicellular consumers. Animals live mostly by ingesting \\n    food and digesting it within specialized cavities. They lack cell wall and show movements.\\nFigure 3.5: The Five kingdoms of classification11\\n3.

Due to their crystalline nature, they are considered as non-living. They are acellular i.e. they do not have cellular organization yet show some characters of living organisms (e.g. they possess DNA). Viruses contain either RNA or DNA, normally encased in protein coat. They reproduce only in living cells, where they cause a number of diseases. They are not considered as organisms and thus are not included in the five-kingdom classification system. Prions and viroids are also acellular particles and are not included in the five-kingdom classification system.\\nHow can you divide the five Kingdoms into two groups on the basis of types of cells?(a) Kingdom monera including organism with prokaryotic cells and(b) Kingdom protista, fungi,plantae and animalia include organisms with eukaryotic cells12\\n3. Biodiversity eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.13.5 Binomial Nomenclature \\n         \\nBinomial nomenclature is the method of giving scientific names to living organisms. As the word \\n“binomial” suggests, the scientific name of a species consists of two names: the first is genus name \\nand the second one is the name of species. Swedish biologist Carolus Linnaeus (1707-1778 AD) first introduced and adopted the system of binomial nomenclature. His system spread rapidly and became popular. Many of his names are in use today.\\nSome of the rules which are universally adopted while suggesting and documenting scientific \\nnames, are:\\n•\\n Scientific \\nnames are usually printed in italics, such as Homo sapiens . When handwritten they \\nare underlined.\\n•\\n The \\nfirst term (generic name) always begins with capital letter, while species name is never \\ncapitalized (even when derived from a proper name).\\n•\\n The \\nscientific name is generally written in full when it is first used. But when several species \\nfrom the same genus are being listed, it may then be abbreviated by just using an initial for genus; for example Escherichia coli becomes E. coli.\\nSignificance\\nIn biological research, common names cause many problems. Different regions have different names for the same organism. For example; common name of onion in Urdu is ‘Piyaz’ but in different regions of Pakistan it is also known as ‘ganda’ or ‘bassal’ or ‘vassal’. In other countries, it has other sets of names. In science, it is known with a single name as Allium cepa. In some cases, different organisms are called by the same common name. For example; the name ‘black bird’ is used for crow as well as for raven.Prions are composed of protein only and Viroids are composed of circular RNA only. Both these particles cause infectious diseases in certain plants.13\\n3. Biodiversity eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Common names have no scientific basis. For example; a fish is a vertebrate animal with fins and \\ngills. But several common names of ‘silver fish’, ‘cray fish’, ‘jelly fish’, and ‘star fish’ do not fit the biologist’s definition of a fish. To avoid all these confusions, organisms are given scientific names by using binomial nomenclature . The value of this system is due to its widespread use and the stability of its names. In binomial nomenclature, every species can be unambiguously identified with just two words. Same name can be used all over the world, in all languages, avoiding difficulties of translation.\\nExamples:\\nCommon \\tName Scientific \\t Name\\nOnion Allium cepa\\nCommon sea star (starfish) Asterias rubens\\nHouse crow Corvus splendens\\n3.6 Conservation Of Biodiversity\\nDuring the last century, loss of biodiversity has been increasingly observed. In the modern era, due to human actions, species and ecosystems are threatened with destruction to an extent rarely seen in Earth history. A species that no longer lives in an ecosystem is called extinct in that ecosystem. When species of an ecosystem become extinct, the stability of ecosystem is harmed. Biologists warn that global ecosystem would collapse if biodiversity continues to be reduced at the same rate.Sometime organisms are named in honor of the research workers who described and classified them. For example; the Orchid tree (Mountain-ebony) was named as Bauhinia variegata after the \\nSwiss botanists Bauhin. Bauhinia variegata is an ornamental tree found in southeast Asia.14\\n3. Biodiversity eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Many plant and animal species have gone extinct in Pakistan. Examples of endangered and extinct \\nanimal species are lion, tiger, Asiatic cheetah, Indian one-horned rhinoceros, swamp deer, Indian wild ass, hangul, blackbuck etc (Figure 3.6).\\n3.6.1 Impact Of Human Beings On Biodiversity\\nBy 10,000 years ago there were about 5 million people on Earth. With the advancement in agriculture and industry, human population began to grow rapidly. Today around 600 million people live on Earth.\\nTo improve the living conditions for 600 million humans, we are imposing serious threats to the \\nsurvival of biodiversity. Habitat loss, deforestation, over-hunting, introduction or removal of species, pollution and climate change are the major causes of species extinction.\\nIn an ecosystem, a species is called extinct when there is no doubt that the last individual of that species has died in that ecosystem. A species is called endangered when it is at risk of extinction in near future.\\nFigure 3.6: The animals that have gone extinct in Pakistan15\\n3. Biodiversity eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1\\nFigure 3.7: Known causes of species extinctionsMore than 260,000 people are added to the world population each day, or more than 180 each \\nminute!\\nHabitat loss is probably the greatest threat to biodiversity on Earth today.\\nEucalyptus  plants were imported from Australia and introduced in Pakistan. These plants consume \\nmore water and have disturbed the water table (level of underground water). It harms other small plants that grow near Eucalyptus  trees.16\\n3. Biodiversity eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.13.6.2 Deforestation And Over-Hunting\\nDeforestation means cutting down of trees for the conversion of a forest to non-forest land. The \\ndestruction of significant areas of forest has resulted in a degraded environment with reduced biodiversity. \\nCauses and effects of deforestation\\nSometime there is slow forest degradation and sometime sudden and catastrophic clear-cutting for urban development. Deforestation can be the result of deliberate removal of forests for wood, agriculture or urban development. Deforestation affects the amount of water in soil and moisture in atmosphere. When there are no trees to keep soil in place, there are more chances of soil erosion. Heavy rainfall washes soil into rivers (Figure 3.8). Essential nutrients are washed out of soil. Rivers become choked up with mud and silt, which can cause floods. The silted water gets stored in dams and it reduces their water storage capacity. Deforestation also contributes to decreased transpiration, which lessens cloud formation. This ultimately reduces the sources of rains.\\nIn developing countries, almost 3 billion people rely on wood for heating and cooking.\\nSea star (starfish) eats mussels. If sea stars are removed from a region in ocean, mussels rapidly increase in number. Large number of mussels prey on small animals and become dangerous for their existance.\\nThe race to produce cash through fruits, spices, sugar, tobacco, soap, rubber, paper, and cloth has stimulated many to get them by using soil and by destroying the forests.17\\n3. Biodiversity eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1\\nFigure 3.8: Soil erosion Figure 3.9: Chopping up of trees for the construction of roads\\nForests support considerable  biodiversity. The utilization of forest products, including timber and \\nfuel wood, have played a key role in human societies. Today, developed countries continue to utilize timber for building houses and wood pulp for making paper.The forest products industry is a large part of the economy in developed and developing countries. Short-term economic gains made by conversion of forest to agriculture often leads to loss of long-term income.\\nForests extract carbon dioxide and pollutants from the air, thus contributing to biosphere stability. \\nForests are also valued for their aesthetic beauty and tourist attraction. These important aspects of forests are also harmed due to deforestation. In Pakistan too, deforestation is a great threat to biodiversity. In the province Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the closed canopy forests are shrinking at approximately 1% per year.\\nOver-hunting\\nOver-hunting has been a significant cause of the extinction of hundreds of species and the endangerment of many more such as whales, ibex, urial, markhor (the national animal of Pakistan) etc. Commercial hunting, both legal and illegal, is the principal threat.18\\n3. Biodiversity eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1The threat to biodiversity is among the hot topics discussed at the UN World summits.\\n3.6.3 Steps For The Conservation Of Biodiversity\\nConservation of biodiversity has become a global concern. Biologists urge the national policy \\nmakers to state a set of rules necessary to protect a species. They demand that laws should define species which are threatened by extinction and must be protected.\\nThough rich in biodiversity, Pakistan today faces severe threats to its animal and plant species. The \\ngreatest concern is the loss of natural habitats. Main causes of this loss are rapid growth in human population and the prevailing poverty in rural areas of Pakistan. In addition, low literacy rate is also a reason for the failure of conservation measures taken so far.The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) and the World \\nWildlife Fund-Pakistan (WWF-P)  work in close coordination with Pakistan’s Ministry of Environment \\nand other government and non-government institutions. The IUCN has prepared the first national Red List (list of endangered or threatened species). \\nFollowing are a few examples of environmental work that has been carried out in Pakistan in order \\nto conserve species and associated habitats.\\n1.\\tNational\\n\\t\\nConservation\\n\\t\\nStrategy: \\t\\n In 1980’s, IUCN and the government of Pakistan formulated \\nthe National Conservation Strategy for Pakistan for the conservation of Pakistan’s biodiversity.  \\n2.\\tUN\\n\\tConvention\\n\\ton\\n\\tCombating\\n\\tDesertification\\n\\t(CCD):\\n This is an international treaty against \\ndamage and poverty in drylands.

Here are a few examples of endangered species in Pakistan.\\nIndus dolphin\\nAccording to WWF-P, only 600 animals of the species of Indus dolphin are left today in the Indus River.

Cells And Tissues eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1The wing of a butterfly is a thin sheet \\nof cells, and so is the shiny layer of our eyes. The meat we eat is composed of cells and its contents soon become part of our cells. Our eyelashes, fingernails, orange juice, the wood of our pencil - all are produced by cells. In this chapter we will take a close look at cells and learn about their internal structure. We will also learn how specific cells group together to form tissues.\\n4.1 Microscopy And The Emergence Of Cell Theory\\nThe use of microscope is known as microscopy. The first compound microscope was developed by Zacharias Janssen, in Holland in 1595. It was simply a tube with lenses at each end and its magnification ranged from 3X to 9X.\\nTwo important terms are used in microscopy i.e. magnification and resolving power. Magnification  \\nis the increase in the apparent size of an object and it is an important factor in microscopy. Resolving \\npower or resolution is the measure of the clarity of an image. It is the minimum distance at which \\ntwo objects can be seen as separate objects. Human naked eye can differentiate between two \\npoints, which are at least 0.1 mm apart. This is known as the resolution of human eye. If we place two objects 0.05 mm apart, human eye would not be able to differentiate them as two separate objects. Magnification and resolution can be increased with the help of lenses.\\n4.1.1 Light microscopy and electron microscopy  \\nNow two types of microscope i.e. light microscope (LM) and electron microscope (EM) are used in microscopy.\\nLight Microscope\\nA light microscope works by passing visible light through a specimen. It uses two glass lenses. One lens produces an enlarged image of the specimen and the second lens magnifies the image and projects it into viewer’s eye or on to photographic film. A photograph taken through a microscope is called a micrograph .Recalling:\\nAll organisms are composed of cells. Some are composed of a single cell, and some, like us, are composed of many cells.3\\n4. Cells And Tissues eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Animation 4.1: Microscope\\nSource & Credit: emaze\\nFigure 4.1: Light microscopes: From earlier (left) to the latest (right)4\\n4. Cells And Tissues eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1\\nFigure 4.2: Light microscopic view; amoebae (left), unicellular algae (right)\\nA light microscope can magnify objects only about 1500 times without causing blurriness i.e. its \\nmagnification is 1500X . Its resolving power is 0.2 micrometer (μm) and 1μm = 1/1000 mm. In \\nother words, the LM cannot resolve (distinguish) objects smaller than 0.2 μm. It is about the size of the smallest bacterium. The image of bacterium can be magnified many times, but light micro -\\nscope cannot show the details of its internal structure.\\nElectron Microscope  \\nIt is the most advanced form of microscope. In EM, object and lens are placed in a vacuum chamber and a beam of electrons is passed through object. Electrons pass through or are reflected from object and make image. Electromagnetic lenses enlarge and focus the image onto a screen or photographic film.\\nElectron microscope has much higher resolving power than light microscope. The most modern \\nEM can distinguish objects as small as 0.2 nanometer (nm) and 1 nm = 1/1000,000 mm. It is a \\nthousand-fold improvement over LM. EM can magnify objects about 250,000 times. Under special conditions EM can detect individual atoms. Cells, organelles and even molecules like DNA and protein are much larger than single atoms.Biologists use two types of electron microscopes i.e. Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) and \\nScanning Electron Microscope (SEM). In TEM, electrons are transmitted through the specimen. TEM is used to study the internal cell structure (Figure 4. 3).When we see a micrograph on the page of a book, we see some words like “LM 109X” printed along the edge of the micrograph. It tells us that the photomicrograph was taken through a light microscope and that the image has been magnified 109 times.\\nEM has revolutionized the study of cells and organelles but it cannot be used to study life processes, because the specimen must be held in a vacuum chamber i.e. all air must be removed. To study the life processes e.g. movement of Amoeba a light microscope is better.5\\n4. Cells And Tissues eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1\\nFigure 4.3: TEM (left) and view of an animal cell (right) through it\\nIn SEM, electrons are reflected from the metal-coated \\nsurfaces.

Cells And Tissues eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.14.1.2 History of the formulation of cell theory \\nIn the history of biology, ancient Greeks were the first who organized the data of natural world. \\nAristotle presented the idea that all animals and plants are somehow related. Later this idea gave \\nrise to questions like “is there a fundamental unit of structure shared by all organisms?”. But before microscopes were first used in 17th century, no one knew with certainty that living organisms do share a fundamental unit i.e. cell.\\nCells were first described by a British scientist, Robert Hooke in 1665. He used his self-made \\nlight microscope to examine a thin slice of cork. Hooke observed a “honeycomb” of tiny empty \\ncompartments. He called the compartments in cork as “cellulae”. His term has come to us as cells (Figure 4.5). The first living cells were observed a few years later by Dutch naturalist Antonie van \\nLeeuwenhoek. He observed tiny organisms (from pond water) under his microscope and called them as “animalcules”.\\nFigure 4.5: Robert Hooke\\nRobert Hooke was a chemist, mathematician and physicist. His remarkable engineering abilities enabled him to invent and improve many mechanical devices, including timepieces, the quadrant, and the Gregorian telescope. His observation about the section of cork is also illustrated here.7\\n4. Cells And Tissues eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1For another century and a half, the general importance of cells was not appreciated by biologists. \\nIn 1809, Jean Baptist de-Lamarck proposed that “no body can have life if its parts are not cellular \\ntissues or are not formed by cellular tissues”. \\nIn 1831, a British botanist Robert Brown discovered nucleus in the cell. In 1838, a German botanist \\nMatthias Schleiden studied plant tissues and made the first statement of cell theory. He stated that all plants are aggregates of individual cells which are fully independent. One year later, in 1839, a German zoologist Theodor Schwann reported that all animal tissues are also composed of \\nindividual cells. Thus Schleiden and Schwann proposed cell theory in its initial form.\\nIn 1855 Rudolf Virchow , a German physician, proposed an important extension of cell theory. He \\nproposed that all living cells arise from pre-existing cells (“Omnis cellula e celula”). In 1862, Louis \\nPasteur provided experimental proof of this idea.Cell theory is regarded as one of the most fundamental knowledge in biology. It has wide ranging \\neffects in all fields of research. After the initial presentation of cell theory by Schleiden and Schwann, many details of cells were studied and cell theory was extended. Cell theory, in its modern form, includes the following principles;1.\\n All organisms are composed of one or more cells.\\n2.\\n Cells are the smallest living things, the basic unit of organization of all organisms.\\n3.\\n Cells arise only by divisions in previously existing cells.\\nFigure 4.6: Three great German biologists8\\n4. Cells And Tissues eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Sub-cellular or Acellular Particles: According to the first principle of the cell theory all \\norganisms are composed of one or more cells. Virus, prions and viroids are not composed of cells; \\nrather they are sub-cellular or acellular particles. They do not run any metabolism inside them. They show some characteristics of living organisms i.e. they can increase in number and can transmit their characters to next generations. We know that such acellular particles are not classified in any of the five kingdoms of organisms.\\nHistory of the formulation of cell theory\\n4.2 Cellular Structures And Functions \\nWe are well familiar with the basic organization of a eukaryotic cell. Here we will get some detailed learning about cellular structure and functions. A cell is made by the assemblage of organelles. There are some structures in cell that are not organelles, but are still very important for cell. These structures are cell wall, cell membrane, cytoplasm, and cytoskeleton.9\\n4. Cells And Tissues eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.14.2.1 Cell Wall  \\nWe know that not all living organisms have cell walls around their cells, e.g. animals and many \\nanimal-like protists. Cell wall is a non-living and strong component of cell, located outside plasma membrane. It provides shape, strength, protection and support to the inner living matter (protoplasm) of cell.\\nPlant cells have a variety of chemicals in their cell walls. The outer layer of plant cell wall is known as \\nprimary wall and cellulose is the most common chemical in it. Some plant cells, for example xylem cells, also have secondary walls on the inner side of primary wall. It is much thicker and contains \\nlignin and some other chemicals. There are pores in the cell walls of adjacent cells, through which their cytoplasm is connected. These pores are called plasmodesmata.\\nFungi and many protists have cell walls although they do not contain cellulose. Their cell walls are made of a variety of chemicals. For example, chitin is present in the cell wall of fungi. Prokaryotes \\nhave a cell wall composed of peptidoglycan that is a complex of amino acids and sugars.\\n4.2.2 Cell Membrane   \\nAll prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have a thin and elastic cell membrane covering the cytoplasm. Cell membrane functions as a semi-permeable barrier, allowing a very few molecules across it while fencing the majority of chemicals inside cell. In this way, cell membrane maintains the internal composition of cell. Animation 4.2: Cell Wall\\nSource and Credit: gifsoup10\\n4. Cells And Tissues eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1\\nFigure 4.7: The ultra-structure of a plant cell11\\n4. Cells And Tissues eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1\\nFigure 4.8: The ultra-structure of an animal cell\\nIn addition to this vital role, cell membrane can also sense chemical messages and can identify \\nother cells. \\nChemical analysis reveals that cell membrane is mainly composed of proteins and lipids with \\nsmall quantities of carbohydrates. Electron microscopic examinations of cell membranes have led \\nto the development of fluid-mosaic model of cell membrane (Figure 4.9).\\nAccording to this model, there is a lipid bilayer in which the protein molecules are embedded. The lipid bilayer gives fluidity and elasticity to membrane. Small amounts of carbohydrates are also found in cell membranes. These are joined with proteins or lipids of membrane. 12\\n4. Cells And Tissues eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1In eukaryotic cells, cholesterol is also present  in lipid bilayer. In eukaryotic cell many organelles e.g. \\nmitochondria, chloroplasts, Golgi apparatus, and endoplasmic reticulum are also bounded by cell membranes.\\n4.2.3 Cytoplasm \\nCytoplasm is the semi-viscous and semi-transparent substance between plasma membrane (cell membrane) and nuclear envelope. It contains water in which many organic molecules (proteins, carbohydrates, lipids) and inorganic salts are completely or partially dissolved.\\nCytoplasm provides space for the proper functioning of organelles and also acts as the site for \\nvarious biochemical (metabolic) reactions. For example, Glycolysis (breakdown of glucose during cellular respiration) occurs in cytoplasm.When we talk about all the membranes of a cell, we say them as cell membranes.\\nWhen we talk about only the outer membrane of cell, we say it as plasma membrane.\\nFigure 4.9: The fluid- mosaic model of cell membrane13\\n4. Cells And Tissues eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1 \\n4.2.4 Cytoskeleton  \\nCytoskeleton is a network of microfilaments and microtubules. Microtubules are made of tubulin \\nprotein and are used by cells to hold their shape. They are also the major component of cilia and \\nflagella. Microfilaments are thinner and are made of actin protein. They help cells to change their \\nshapes.\\n4.2.5 Cell Organelles  \\nOrganelles are small structures within cells that perform dedicated functions. There are about a dozen types of organelles commonly found in eukaryotic cells. We will go through the basic facts about important cell organelles.\\nFigure 4.10: Cytoskeleton14\\n4. Cells And Tissues eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.14.2.6 Nucleus  \\nA prominent nucleus occurs in eukaryotic cells. In animal cells it is present in the centre while in \\nmature plant cells, due to the formation of large central vacuole, it is pushed to side. Nucleus is bounded by a double membrane known as nuclear envelope. Nuclear envelope contains many \\nsmall pores that enable it to act as a semi-permeable membrane. Inside nuclear envelope, a granular fluid i.e. nucleoplasm is present. Nucleoplasm contains one or two nucleoli (singular; nucleolus) \\nand chromosomes (Figure 4.11).\\nNucleolus  is a dark spot and it is the site where ribosomal RNA are formed and assembled as \\nribosomes. Chromosomes are visible only during cell division while during interphase (non-\\ndividing phase) of cell they are in the form of fine thread-like structures known as chromatin . \\nChromosomes are composed of Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and proteins.The prokaryotic cells do not contain prominent nucleus. Their chromosome is made of DNA only \\nand is submerged in cytoplasm.\\nFigure 4.11: Structure of Nucleus15\\n4.

Cells And Tissues eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Ribosomes\\nRibosomes are tiny granular structures that are either floating freely in cytoplasm or are bound \\nto endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Each ribosome is made up of almost equal amounts of proteins and ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Ribosomes are not bound by membranes and so are also found in prokaryotes. Eukaryotic ribosomes are slightly larger than prokaryotic ones. \\nRibosomes are the sites of protein synthesis. Protein synthesis is extremely important to cells, and \\nso large numbers of ribosomes are found throughout cells. When a ribosome is not working, it disassembles into two smaller units (Figure 4.12) .\\nFigure 4.12: Ribosome\\nAnimation 4.4: Ribosomes\\nSource and Credit: Nature17\\n4. Cells And Tissues eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Animation 4.5: Ribosomes\\nSource and Credit: nature18\\n4. Cells And Tissues eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Mitochondria\\nMitochondria (singular: mitochondrion) are double membrane-bounded structures found only in \\neukaryotes. These are the sites of aerobic respiration, and are the major energy production centres.The outer membrane of a mitochondrion is smooth but the inner membrane forms many infoldings, called cristae (singular crista) in the inner mitochondrial matrix. This serves to increase the surface \\narea of inner membrane on which membrane-bound reactions can take place (Figure 4.13).Mitochondria have their own DNA and ribosomes. The ribosomes of mitochondria are more similar to bacterial ribosomes than to eukaryotic ribosomes.\\nFigure 4.13: Mitochondrion\\nAnimation 4.6: Mitochondria\\nSource and Credit: ibiblio19\\n4. Cells And Tissues eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Plastids\\nPlastids are also membrane-bound organelles that only occur in the cells of plants and photosynthetic \\nprotists (algae). They are of three type i.e chloroplasts, leucoplasts and chromoplasts. Like mitochondria, chloroplast  is also bound by a double membrane. The outer membrane is \\nsmooth while the inner membrane gives rise to sacs called thylakoids . The stack of thylakoids is \\ncalled granum (plural = grana). \\nGrana float in the inner fluid of chloroplast i.e. stroma (Figure 4.14). Chloroplasts are the sites \\nof photosynthesis in eukaryotes. They contain chlorophyll (the green pigment necessary for \\nphotosynthesis) and associated pigments. These pigments are present in the thylakoids of grana.The second type of plastids in plant cells are chromoplasts . They contain pigments associated with \\nbright colors and are present in the cells of flower petals and fruits. Their function is to give colors to these parts and thus help in pollination and dispersal of fruit.Leucoplasts are the third type of plastids. They are colourless and store starch, proteins and lipids. They are present in the cells of those parts where food is stored.\\nEndoplasmic reticulum (ER)\\nEndoplasmic reticulum is a network of interconnected channels that extends from cell membrane to nuclear envelope. The network exists in two forms:Figure 4.14: Chloroplast\\n20\\n4. Cells And Tissues eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum (RER) is so-named because of its rough appearance due to \\nnumerous ribosomes that are attached to it (Figure 4.15). Due to the presence of ribosomes, RER serves a function in protein synthesis.Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum (SER) lacks ribosomes and is involved in lipid metabolism and in the transport of materials from one part of cell to other. It also detoxifies the harmful chemicals that have entered cell.\\nImage 4.1: Endoplasmic reticulum\\nSource and Credit: dynamicscience\\nFigure 4.15: Smooth and Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum21\\n4.

Cells And Tissues eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Golgi Apparatus\\nAn Italian physician Camillo Golgi discovered a set of flattened sacs (cisternae) in cell. In this \\nset, many cisternae are stacked over each other. The complete set of cisternae is called Golgi \\napparatus or Golgi complex. It is found in both plant and animal cells. It modifies molecules coming \\nfrom rough ER and packs them into small membrane bound sacs called Golgi vesicles. These sacs \\ncan be transported to various locations in cell or to its exterior, in the form of secretions (Figure 4.17).\\nAnimation 4.8: Golgi Apparatus\\nSource and Credit: Ameoba sisters23\\n4.

Lysosomes contain strong digestive enzymes and work for the breakdown (digestion) of food and waste materials within cell. During its function, a lysosome fuses with the vacuole that contains the targeted material and its enzymes break down the material.\\nLet’s think; What can happen when a lysosome bursts inside the cell and all its enzymes are \\nreleased in the cytoplasm?24\\n4.

Cells And Tissues eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1\\nFigure 4.18: De Duve; Formation and Function of lysosome\\nCentrioles\\nAnimals and many unicellular organisms have hollow and cylindrical organelles known as \\ncentrioles. Each centriole is made of nine triplets of microtubules (made up of tubulin protein).Animal cells have two centrioles located near the exterior surface of nucleus. The two centrioles are collectively called a centrosome. Their function is to help in the formation of spindle fibers \\nduring cell division. In some cells, centrioles are involved in the formation of cilia and flagella.\\nFigure 4.19: A Centriole26\\n4. Cells And Tissues eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Vacuoles\\nVacuoles are fluid filled single-membrane bound organelles. Cells have many small vacuoles in \\ntheir cytoplasm. However, when a plant cells matures its small vacuoles absorb water and fuse to form a single large vacuole in centre. Cell in this state becomes turgid. Many cells take in materials from outside in the form of food vacuole and then digest the material with the help of lysosomes. Some unicellular organisms use contractile vacuole for the elimination of wastes from their bodies.Animation 4.10: Centrioles \\nSource and Credit: ibiblio\\nWhich of the following organelles does not belong to others in the list: mitochondrion, chloroplast, ribosome, lysosome?

Their chromosome consists of DNA only and it floats in cytoplasm near centre. This region is called nucleoid.\\nOther Organelles:Eukaryotic cells have membrane-bounded organelles like mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum etc while such membrane-bounded organelles are not present in prokaryotic cells. The ribosomes of eukaryotic cells are larger in size as compared to the ribosomes of prokaryotic cells.\\nSize:Eukaryotic cells are, on average, ten times larger than prokaryotic cells.\\nCell Wall:The cell wall of eukaryotic cell is made of cellulose (in plants) or chitin (in fungi). All prokaryotic cells have cell wall, which is made of peptidoglycan (a large polymer of amino acids and sugars).\\n4.2.7 Relationship Between Cell Function And Cell Structure\\nThe bodies of animals and plants are made of different cell types. Each type performs specific function and all coordinated functions become the life processes of organism. Cells of one type may differ from those of other types in the following respects.\\nDo you know?\\nHuman body is made of about 200 types of cells.30\\n4.

It can be explained by the following \\nexamples of the cells of human body:•\\n Nerve cells conduct nerve impulse and thus contribute in coordination in body.\\n•\\n Muscle cells undergo contraction and share their role in movements in body.\\n•\\n Red \\nblood cells carry oxygen and white blood cells kill foreign agents and so contribute in the \\nroles of blood in transportation and defence.\\n•\\n Some \\nskin cells act as physical barriers against foreign materials and some as receptors for \\ntemperature, touch, pain etc.\\n•\\n The \\ncells of bone deposit calcium in their extracellular spaces to make the bone tough and thus \\ncontribute to the supporting role of bones.\\nCell as an Open System\\nA cell works as an open system i.e. it takes in substances needed for its metabolic activities \\nthrough its cell membrane. Then it performs the metabolic processes assigned to it. Products and by-products are formed in metabolism. Cell either utilizes the products or transports them to other cells. The by-products are either stored or are excreted out of cell.31\\n4. Cells And Tissues eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.14.3 Cell Size And Surface Area To Volume Ratio\\n \\nCells vary greatly in size. The smallest cells are bacteria called mycoplasmas, with diameter between \\n0.1 μm to 1.0 μm. The bulkiest cells are bird eggs, and the longest cells are some muscle cells and nerve cells. Most cells lie between these extremes. \\nCell size and shape are related to cell function. Bird eggs are bulky because they contain a large \\namount of nutrient for the developing young. Long muscle cells are efficient in pulling different body parts together. Lengthy nerve cells can transmit messages between different parts of body. On the other hand, small cell size also has many benefits. For example human red blood cells are only 8 μm in diameter and therefore can move through our tiniest blood vessels i.e. capillaries.Most cells are small in size. In relation of their volumes, large cells have less surface area as compared to small cells. Figure 4.21 shows this relationship using cube-shaped cells. The figure shows 1 large cell and 27 small cells. In both cases, the total volume is same:\\n                  Volume = 30 μm X 30 μm X 30 μm = 27,000 μm\\n3\\nIn contrast to the total volume, the total surface areas are very different. Because a cubical shape \\nhas 6 sides, its surface area is 6 times the area of 1 side. \\nThe surface areas of cubes are as follows:•\\n Surface area of 1 large cube = 6 X (30 μm X 30 μm) = 5400 μm2\\n• Surface area of 1 small cube = 6 X (10 μm X 10 μm) = 600 μm2 \\nand\\n•\\n Surface area of 27 small cubes = 27 X 600 μm2 = 16, 200 μm232\\n4. Cells And Tissues eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1\\nFigure 4.21: Effect of cell size on surface area\\nNeed of nutrients and rate of waste production are directly proportional to cell volume. Cell takes up \\nnutrients and excretes wastes through its surface cell membrane. So a large volume cell demands large surface area. But as the figure shows, a large cell has a much smaller surface area relative to its volume than smaller cells have. Hence we conclude that the membranes of small cells can serve their volumes more easily than the membrane of a large cell.\\n4.4 Passage Of Molecules Into And Out Of Cells\\nWe know that cell membranes act as barriers to most, but not all, molecules. That is why cell membranes are called semi-permeable membranes. Cell membranes maintain equilibrium \\ninside cell as well as outside by exchanging matter with cells’ environment according to needs. Cell membranes do it through the phenomena of diffusion, facilitated diffusion, osmosis, filtration, active transport, endocytosis and exocytosis.\\nDiffusion\\nDiffusion is the movement of molecules from an area of higher concentration to the area of lower concentration i.e. along concentration gradient. The molecules of any substance (solid, liquid or gas) are in motion when that substance is above 0 degrees Kelvin or -273 degrees Centigrade. In a substance, majority of the molecules move from higher to lower concentration, although there are some that move from low to high. The overall (or net) movement is thus from high to low33\\n4. Cells And Tissues eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1concentration. Eventually, the molecules reach a state of equilibrium where they are distributed \\nequally throughout the area.\\nDiffusion is one principle method of movement of substances within cells, as well as across cell \\nmembrane. Carbon dioxide, oxygen, glucose etc. can cross cell membranes by diffusion. Gas exchange in gills and lungs occurs by this process. Movement of glucose molecules from small intestine lumen into the blood capillaries of villi is another example of diffusion. Because a cell does not expend energy when molecules diffuse across its membrane, the diffusion is type of passive transport.\\nFacilitated diffusion\\nMany molecules do not diffuse freely across cell membranes because of their size or charge. Such molecules are taken into or out of the cells with the help of transportproteins present in cell membranes. When a transport protein moves a substance from higher to lower concentration, the process is called facilitated diffusion. The rate of facilitated diffusion is higher than simple diffusion.Facilitated diffusion is also a type of passive transport because there is no expenditure of energy in this process (Figure 4.22).Animation 4.13: Diffusion\\nSource and Credit: wikipedia34\\n4. Cells And Tissues eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1\\nFigure 4.22: Diffusion and facilitated diffusion through cell membrane\\nOsmosis\\nOsmosis is the movement of water across a semi-permeable membrane from a solution of lesser \\nsolute concentration to a solution of higher solute concentration. \\nThe rules of osmosis can be best understood through the concept of tonicity of solutions. The term \\ntonicity refers to the relative concentration of solutes in the solutions being compared.•\\n A \\nHypertonic solution  has relatively more solute.\\n•\\n A \\nHypotonic solution  has relatively less solute.\\n•\\n Isotonic  solutions have equal concentrations of solutes.\\n35\\n4. Cells And Tissues eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Water balance problems\\nWhen an animal cell, such as red blood cell, is placed in an isotonic solution, the cell volume \\nremains constant because the rate at which water is entering cell is equal to the rate at which it is moving out. When a cell is placed in a hypotonic solution, water enters and cell swells and may rupture like an over-filled balloon. Similarly, an animal cell placed in a hypertonic solution will lose water and will shrink in size. So in hypotonic environments (e.g. freshwater) animal cells must have ways to prevent excessive entry of water and in hypertonic environments (e.g. seawater) they must have ways to prevent excessive loss of water.Animation 4.14: Osmosis\\nSource and Credit: majordifferences36\\n4. Cells And Tissues eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1\\nFigure 4.23: Effect of tonicity on animal and plant cellWater balance problems are somewhat different for plant cells because of their rigid cell walls. Most \\nplant cells live in hypotonic environment i.e. there is low concentration of solutes in extracellular fluids than in cells. As a result, water tends to move first inside cell and then inside vacuole. When vacuole increases in size, cytoplasm presses firmly against the interior of cell wall, which expands a little. Due to strong cell wall, plant cell does not rupture but instead becomes rigid. In this condition, the outward pressure on cell wall exerted by internal water is known as turgor pressure and the \\nphenomenon is turgor. In isotonic environment, the net uptake of water is not enough to make \\nthe cell turgid and it is flaccid (loose / not firm). In a hypertonic environment a plant cell loses water and cytoplasm shrinks. The shrinking of cytoplasm is called plasmolysis.37\\n4. Cells And Tissues eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Osmosis and Guard cells\\nStomata (openings) in leaf epidermis are surrounded by guard cells. During daytime guards cells \\nare making glucose and so are hypertonic (have higher concentration of glucose) than their nearby epidermis cells. Water enters them from other cells and they swell. In this form, they assume a rigid bowed shape and a pore is created between them. At night when there is low solute concentration in guard cells, water leaves them and they become flaccid. In this form, both guard cells rest against one another and the opening is closed.\\nApplication  of  knowledge  about semi-permeable membranes\\nThe knowledge about semi-permeable membranes is applied for various purposes. We know that semi-permeable membrane is capable of separating substances. Artificially synthesized semi-permeable membranes are used for the separation of bacteria from viruses, because bacteria cannot cross a semi-permeable membrane. In advanced water-treatment technologies, membrane-based filtration systems are used. In this process, semi-permeable membranes separate salts from water (reverse osmosis).\\nFiltration\\nFiltration is a process by which small molecules are forced to move across semipermeable membrane with the aid of hydrostatic (water) pressure or blood pressure.\\nThe turgor of cells is responsible for maintaining shapes of non-woody plants and soft portions of trees and shrubs.\\nExplain why it is not enough just to say that a solution is “hypertonoc“.Hypertonic and hypotonic are relative terms. therefore you must say what the solution \\nis compared to.38\\n4. Cells And Tissues eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1\\nFigure 4.24: Filtration through the cell membrane of capillary wall\\nActive transport\\nActive transport is the movement of molecules from an area of lower concentration to the area \\nof higher concentration. This movement against the concentration gradient requires energy in the form of ATP.In this process, carrier proteins of cell membrane use energy to move the molecules against the concentration gradient. For example, the membranes of nerve cells have carrier proteins in the form of “sodium-potassium pump”. In a resting (not conducting nerve impulse) nerve cell, this \\npump spends energy (ATP) to maintain higher concentrations of K\\n+ and lower concentrations of \\nNa+ inside the cell. For this purpose, the pump actively moves Na+ to the outside of the cell where \\nthey are already in higher concentration. Similarly this pumps moves K+ from outside to inside \\nthe cell where they are in higher concentration (Figure 4.25).\\nIn diffusion and filtration, only small molecules can pass across membrane. Which process would move the molecules faster?Filtration39\\n4. Cells And Tissues eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1\\nFigure 4.25: Sodium-potassium pump, showing active transport\\nEndocytosis\\nIt is the process of cellular ingestion of bulky materials by the infolding of cell membrane (see the \\nsteps of endocytosis in Figure 4.26). The two forms of endocytosis are phagocytosis  (cellular eating) and pinocytosis  (cellular drinking). \\nIn phagocytosis cell takes in solid material while in pinocytosis cell takes in liquid in the form of droplets.\\nIn a colony of cells there are many cells and each cell performs all general functions on its \\nown. Such a group does not get tissue level of organization because cells are not specific \\nand there is no coordination among them.40\\n4. Cells And Tissues eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Exocytosis\\nIt is the process through which bulky material is exported (see the steps in Figure 4.26). This process \\nadds new membrane which replaces the part of cell membrane lost during endocytosis.\\nFigure 4.26: Endocytosis and Exocytosis\\n4.5 Animal And Plant Tissues \\nWe are familiar with the levels of structural organization of life and recognize tissue as a group of similar cells specialized for the performance of a common function. In this topic we will learn about the major types of animal and plant tissues, with reference to their cell specificities, locations and functions.41\\n4. Cells And Tissues eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.14.5.1 Animal Tissues \\nIn the bodies of animals, there are four major categories of tissues: epithelial tissue, connective \\ntissue, muscle tissue, and nervous tissue.\\nEpithelial tissue\\nEpithelial tissue covers the outside of body and lines organs and cavities. The cells in this tissue are very closely packed together. This tissue has many types on the basis of the shape of cells as well as the number of cell layers. Some types include: Squamous epithelium consists of a single layer of flat cells. It is found in lungs, heart and blood vessels. Here, it allows the movement of materials across it. Cuboidal epithelium consists of a single layer of cube-shaped cells. It is found in kidney tubes, small glands etc. where it makes secretions.\\nFigure 4.27: Epithelial tissues in animals42\\n4. Cells And Tissues eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Columnar epithelium has elongated cells. It is found in alimentary canal, gall bladder etc. where \\nit makes secretions.\\nCiliated columnar  epithelium has elongated cells with cilia. It is present in trachea and bronchi \\nand propels mucous.Stratified squamous epithelium has many layers of flat cells. It is present in the lining of oesophagus \\nand mouth and also over the skin. It protects the inner parts.\\nConnective tissue\\nAs the name shows, connective tissue serves a “connecting” function. It supports and binds other tissues. Unlike epithelial tissue, connective tissue has cells scattered throughout an extracellular matrix. Common examples of this tissue are cartilage (found around the ends of bones, in external ear, nose, trachea etc.), bone and blood. The adipose tissue (found around kidneys, under skin, in abdomen etc.) is also a type of connective tissue. It provides energy and support organs.\\nFigure 4.28: Connective tissues in animals43\\n4. Cells And Tissues eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Do you know?\\nExercise does not increase the numbers of our  skeletal muscle cells; it simply enlarges those \\nalready present\\nMuscle Tissue\\nMuscle tissue consists of bundles of long cells called muscle fibers. It is the most abundant tissue \\nin an animal. The cells of this tissue have ability to contract. There are three kinds of muscle tissue.\\nFigure 4.29: Types of muscle tissue44\\n4. Cells And Tissues eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Skeletal muscles or striated muscles are attached to bones. Their cells are striated (striped) and \\ncontain many nuclei. They are responsible for the movements of bones.\\nSmooth muscles are found in the walls of alimentary canal, urinary bladder, blood vessels etc. \\nThey contain smooth (non-straited) cells, each with a single nucleus. They are responsible for the movement of substances.\\nCardiac muscles are present in the wall of heart. Their cells are also striated but there is a single \\nnucleus in each cell. They produce heartbeat.\\nSkeletal muscles are voluntary in action i.e. their contraction is under the control of our will. Smooth \\nand cardiac muscles are involuntary in action i.e. their contraction is not under the control of our will.\\nNervous tissue\\nWe know that an animal’s survival depends on its ability to respond appropriately to the stimuli from its environment. This ability requires the transmission of information among the parts of body. Nervous tissue forms a communication system and performs this task. This tissue is mainly composed of nerve cells or neurons,  which are specialized to conduct messages in the form of \\nnerve impulses. Nervous tissue is found in brain, spinal cord and nerves. \\nFigure 4.30: Nervous tissue45\\n4. Cells And Tissues eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1\\nFigure 4.31: Different tissues in human body\\n4.5.2 Plant Tissues \\nAs in animals, the cells of plants are grouped into tissues with characteristic functions such as \\nphotosynthesis, transport etc. There are two major categories of tissues in plants i.e. simple tissues and compound (complex) tissues.\\nWhen you hear that epithelial tissue has a tightly packed structure what function do you expect?Barrier and protective function46\\n4. Cells And Tissues eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Simple tissues\\nThe tissues which are made of single type of cells, are called simple tissues. They are of two types \\ni.e. meristematic tissues and permanent tissues.\\nA- Meristematic Tissues\\nThese tissues are composed of cells, which have the ability to divide. The cells are thin walled, have large nucleus and small or no vacuoles. They do not have inter-cellular spaces among them. Two main types of meristematic tissues are recognized in plants.i. Apical meristems are located at the apices (tips) of roots and shoot. When they divide they cause \\nincrease in the length of plant. Such growth is called primary growth.ii. Lateral meristems are located on the lateral sides of roots and shoot. By dividing, they are \\nresponsible for increase in growth of plant parts. This growth is called secondary growth. They are further of two types i.e. vascular cambium (located between xylem and phloem) and cork \\ncambium (in the outer lateral sides of plant).\\nIntercalary meristem is in the form of small patches among the mature tissues. These are common \\nin grasses and help in the regeneration of parts removed by herbivores etc.\\nFigure 4.32: a- Apical meristem at root tip and\\n                            b- Vascular and cork cambium in stem47\\n4. Cells And Tissues eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1B- Permanent Tissues\\nPermanent tissues originate from meristematic tissue. The cells of these tissues do not have the \\nability to divide. They are further classified into following types:\\n1. Epidermal Tissues\\nEpidermal tissues are composed of a single layer of cells and they cover plant body. They act as a barrier between environment and internal plant tissues. In roots, they are also responsible for the absorption of water and minerals. On stem and leaves they secrete cutin (the coating of cutin is called cuticle) which prevents evaporation.Epidermal tissues also have some specialized structure that perform specific functions; for example root hairs  and stomata.\\nFigure 4.33: Epidermal tissue\\n Figure 4.33-b : Ground tissue\\n2. Ground Tissues\\nGround tissues are simple tissues made up of parenchyma cells.  Parenchyma cells are the most \\nabundant cells in plants. Overall they are spherical but flat at point of contact. They have thin primary cell walls and have large vacuoles for storage of food. In leaves, they are called mesophyll \\nand are the sites of photosynthesis. In other parts, they are the sites of respiration and protein synthesis.48\\n4. Cells And Tissues eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Do you know?\\nMost parenchyma cells can develop the \\nability to divide and differentiate into other types of cells and they do so during the process of repairing an injury.\\n3. Support Tissues\\nThese tissues provide strength and flexibility to plants. They are further of two types.\\ni. Collenchyma Tissue\\nThey are found in cortex (beneath epidermis) of young stems and in the midribs of leaves and in petals of flowers. They are made of elongated cells with unevenly thickened primary cell walls. They are flexible and function to support the organs in which they are found.\\nii. Sclerenchyma Tissue\\nThey are composed of cells with rigid secondary cell walls. Their cell walls are hardened with lignin, which is the main chemical component of wood. Mature sclerenchyma cells cannot elongate and most of them are dead.\\nFigure 4.34: Collenchyma tissueFigure 4.35: Schlerenchyma tissue49\\n4. Cells And Tissues eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Compound (Complex) Tissues\\nA plant tissue composed of more than one type of cell is called a compound or complex tissue. \\nXylem and phloem tissues, found only in vascular plants, are examples of compound tissues.\\n1. Xylem Tissue\\nXylem tissue is responsible for the transport of water and dissolved substances from roots to the aerial parts. Due to the presence of lignin, the secondary walls of its cells are thick and rigid. That is why xylem tissue also provides support to plant body. Two types of cell are found in xylem tissue i.e. vessel elements and tracheids. Vessel elements or cells have thick secondary cell walls. They \\nlack end walls and join together to form long tubes. Tracheids are slender cells with overlapping \\nends. \\nFigure 4.36: Xylem tissue\\nFigure 4.37: Phloem tissue\\n2. Phloem Tissue\\nPhloem tissue is responsible for the conduction of dissolved organic matter (food) between different parts of plant body. Phloem tissue contains sieve tube cells ands companion cells. Sieve tube cells \\nare long and their end walls have small pores. Many sieve tube cells join to form long sieve tubes. Companion cells  make proteins for sieve tube cells\\nBirds fly by flapping their wings. What do you thing is the type of muscle responsible for wings flapping?Skeletal50\\n4.

Cell Cycle eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1The most basic characteristic of life is reproduction. Reproduction occurs at different levels of \\norganization. Parts of cell such as chromosomes produce new chromosomes, cells produce new cells and individuals produce offspring like themselves. If we recall from chapter 1, we should remember Rudolf Virchow. He proposed an important biological principle i.e. all cells come from cells. This principle tells us that the continuation of life, including all aspects of reproduction, is based on the reproduction of cells. We commonly refer cellular reproduction as cell division and it is a part of the whole life of a cell i.e. cell cycle.\\n5.1 Cell Cycle  \\nCell cycle is the series of events from the time a cell is produced until it completes mitosis and produces new cells. Cell cycle consists of two major phases i.e. interphase and mitotic phase (M phase). Mitotic phase is a relatively short period of cell cycle. It alternates with the much longer interphase, where cell prepares itself for division.Interphase is the time when a cell’s metabolic activity is very high, as it performs its various functions. It is divided into three phases, G1 (first gap), S (synthesis), and G2 (second gap).\\nG1 phase: After its production, a cell starts its cell cycle in G1 phase. During this phase, cell increases \\nits supply of proteins, increases the number of its organelles (such as mitochondria, ribosomes), and grows in size. This phase is also marked by the synthesis of various enzymes that are required in next phase i.e. S phase for the duplication of chromosomes.\\nS phase: In this phase, cell duplicates its chromosomes. As a result, each chromosome consists of \\ntwo sister chromatids. \\nG2 phase:  In the G2 phase, cell prepares proteins that are essential for mitosis, mainly for the \\nproduction of spindle fibres.\\nAfter the G2 phase of interphase, cell enters the division phase i.e. M phase. It is characterized by \\nmitosis, in which cell divides into the two daughter cells.\\nCells that have temporarily or permanently stopped dividing are said to have entered a state of \\nquiescence, called G0 phase.Typically,interphase lasts for at least 90% of the total time required for the cell cycle.3\\n5. Cell Cycle eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1\\nFigure 5.1: The eukaryotic cell cycleAnimation 5.1: Cell cycle\\nSource & Credit: amersol4\\n5. Cell Cycle eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1 Inhibition of protein synthesis during G2 phase prevents cell from undergoing mitosis.\\nG0 phase: In multicellular eukaryotes, cells enter G0 phase from G1 and stop dividing. Some cells \\nremain in G0 for indefinite period e.g. neurons. Some cells enter G0 phase semipermanently e.g. \\nsome cells of liver and kidney. Many cells do not enter G0 and continue to divide throughout an organism’s life, e.g. epithelial cells.\\nThe events of cell cycle are ordered and directional i.e each event occurs in a sequential \\nfashion and it is impossible to “reverse” the cycle.\\n5.2 Mitosis  \\n  \\nIn 1880s, a German biologist Walther Flemming observed that in a dividing cell, nucleus passes \\nthrough a series of changes which he called mitosis. Mitosis is the type of cell division in which a \\ncell divides into two daughter cells, each with the same number of chromosomes as were present in parent cell.\\nMitosis occurs only in eukaryotic cells. In multicellular organisms, the somatic cells undergo mitosis. \\nProkaryotic cells undergo a process similar to mitosis called binary fission. They do not undergo proper mitosis. Why?\\n5.2.1 Phases Of Mitosis \\n  \\nThe process of mitosis is complex and highly regulated. There are two major phases i.e. the division \\nof nucleus known as karyokinesis; and the division of cytoplasm known as cytokinesis.\\nA. Karyokinesis : The division of nucleus is further divided into four phases i.e. prophase, metaphase, \\nanaphase and telophase.5\\n5. Cell Cycle eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1i. Prophase\\nNormally, the genetic material in nucleus is in a loose thread-like form called chromatin. At the onset of prophase, chromatin condenses into highly ordered structures called chromosomes. Since the genetic material has already been duplicated earlier in S phase, each chromosome is made of two sister chromatids, bound together at the same centromere. Each chromosome also has kinetochore at centromere. Kinetochore is a complex protein structure that is the point where spindle fibers attach.\\nThere are two centrioles (collectively called a centrosome) close to nucleus (recall from chapter \\n4: Figure 4.19). Each centriole duplicates and thus two daughter centrosomes are formed. Both centrosomes migrate to the opposite poles of cell. Here, they give rise to microtubules by joining tubulin proteins present in cytoplasm. The microtubules thus formed are called spindle fibres. \\nComplete set of spindle fibres is known as mitotic spindle. By this time, nucleolus and nuclear envelope have degraded, and spindle fibres have invaded the central space.\\nIn highly vacuolated plant cells, nucleus has to migrate to the centre of cell before prophase. The \\ncells of plants lack centrioles. So, spindle fibres are formed by the aggregation of tubulin proteins on the surface of nuclear envelope during prophase.Somatic cells are those which form the body of organisms while germ line cells are those \\nwhich give rise to gametes. Somatic cells undergo mitosis while germ line cells undergo \\nmeiosis.\\nProkaryotes do not have proper nucleus and do not form spindles during division. That is why \\ntheir division is not called mitosis.6\\n5. Cell Cycle eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Animation 5.2: Stages of Mitosis\\nSource and Credit: Ameoba sisters7\\n5. Cell Cycle eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1ii. Metaphase\\nWhen spindle fibres have grown to sufficient length, some spindle fibres, known as kinetochore \\nfibres, attach with the kinetochores of chromosomes. Two kinetochore fibres from opposite poles attach with each chromosome. Chromosomes arrange themselves along the equator of cell forming a metaphase plate. A number of other fibres (non-kinetochore) from the opposite centrosomes \\nattach with each other.\\niii. Anaphase\\nWhen a kinetochore spindle fibre connects with the kinetochore of chromosome, it starts to pull toward the originating centrosomes. The pulling force divides the chromosome’s sister chromatids and they separate. These sister chromatids are now sister chromosomes, and they are pulled apart toward the respective centrosomes. The other spindle fibres (non-kinetochore) also elongate. At the end of anaphase, cell has succeeded in separating identical copies of chromosomes into two groups at the opposite poles.\\niv. Telophase\\nTelophase is a reversal of prophase. A new nuclear envelope forms around each set of separated chromosomes. Both sets of chromosomes, now surrounded by new nuclear envelopes, unfold back into chromatin. Nuclear division is completed, but cell division has yet one more step to complete. (Figure 5.2)\\nB. Cytokinesis:\\nCytokinesis is the division of cytoplasm. In animal cells, cytokinesis occurs by a process known as \\ncleavage. A cleavage furrow develops where the metaphase plate used to be. The furrow deepens and eventually pinches the parent cell into two daughter cells.Cytokinesis in plant cells occurs differently. Vesicles derived from the Golgi apparatus move to \\nthe middle of cell and fuse to form a membrane-bounded disc called cell plate or phragmoplast. The plate grows outward and more vesicles fuse with it. Finally, membranes of cell plate fuse with plasma membrane and its contents join the parental cell wall. The result is two daughter cells, each bounded by its own plasma membrane and cell wall (Figure 5.3)\\nNucleus is visible only in interphase while chromosomes are only visible in cell division stage. Why is that?Nuclear membrane breaks during cell division so there is no distinct nucleus.

This is the basis of the development of a multicellular body from a single cell i.e. zygote and also the basis of the growth of multicellular body.\\nFigure 5.4: Development of a single cell (zygote) into a multicellular body10\\n5. Cell Cycle eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Cell replacement:\\nIn some parts of body, e.g. skin and digestive tract, cells are constantly sloughed off and replaced \\nby new ones. New cells are formed by mitosis and so are exact copies of the cells being replaced. Similarly, red blood cells have short life span (about 4 months) and new red blood cells are formed by mitosis.\\nRegeneration: \\nSome organisms can regenerate parts of their bodies. The production of new cells is achieved by mitosis. For example; sea star regenerates its lost arm through mitosis.\\nAsexual reproduction: \\nSome organisms produce genetically similar offspring through asexual reproduction. Mitosis is a mean of asexual reproduction. For example; hydra reproduces asexually by budding. The cells at the surface of hydra undergo mitosis and form a mass called bud. Mitosis continues in the cells of bud and it grows into a new individual. The same division happens during asexual reproduction (vegetative propagation) in plants.\\nFigure 5.5: Regeneration in sea star\\nFigure 5.6: Asexual reproduction11\\n5. Cell Cycle eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Errors In Mitosis\\nErrors in the control of mitosis may cause cancer. All cells have genes that control the timing \\nand number of mitosis. Sometimes mutations occur in such genes and cells continue to divide. It results in growths of abnormal cells called tumors. As long as these tumors  remain in their \\noriginal location, they are called benign tumours. But if they invade other tissues, they are called malignant  (cancerous) tumors and their cells are called cancer cells. Such tumors can send cancer \\ncells to other parts in body where new tumors may form. This phenomenon is called metastasis (spreading of disease).\\nPractical Work:\\nPreparation of root tip squashes and study of the stages of mitosis\\nThe number of cells within an organism increases by mitosis and this is the basis of growth in \\nmulticellular organisms.\\nProblem: \\nWhile observing the cells from the tip of an onion root, can we identify cell in different stages of mitosis.

Cell Cycle eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1\\nFigure 5.7: Cells in different stages of cell cycle14\\n5. Cell Cycle eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.15.3 Meiosis    \\nMeiosis is the process by which one diploid (2n) eukaryotic cell divides to generate four haploid \\n(1n) daughter cells. Diploid means the cells in which chromosomes are in pairs (homologous pairs) while haploid means the cells with half the number of chromosomes i.e. chromosomes are not in the form of pairs.\\n5.3.1 Phases Of Meiosis    \\nMeiosis was discovered and described for the first time in 1876, by a German biologist Oscar \\nHertwig. The preparatory steps of meiosis are identical to the interphase of mitosis. Interphase is divided into the same three phases i.e. G1, S phase, and G2. Interphase is followed by meiosis I and meiosis II.\\nMeiosis I\\nIn meiosis I, the homologous chromosomes in a diploid cell separate and so two haploid daughter cells are produced. It is the step in meiosis that generates genetic variations. Meiosis I occurs in two main steps i.e. karyokinesis and cytokinesis. The karyokinesis of Meiosis I is subdivided into prophase I, metaphase I, anaphase I, and telophase I.\\nProphase I\\nProphase I is the longest phase in meiosis. During this stage, chromatin condenses into chromosomes. The homologous chromosomes line up with each other and form pairs by a process called synapsis. \\nEach pair of homologous chromosomes is called bivalent. Each bivalent has four chromatids, so it \\nmay also be called a tetrad. The two non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes join each other at certain points along their length. These points of attachment are called chiasmata.  In the \\nnext stage, the non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes exchange their segments and the phenomenon is known as crossing over  (Figure 5.8).The word meiosis comes from Greek word ‘meioun’, meaning “to make smaller,” since it results in \\na reduction in chromosome number.15\\n5. Cell Cycle eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1\\nFigure 5.8: Crossing over\\nAnimation 5.3: Meiosis\\nSource & Credit: geocities16\\n5. Cell Cycle eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1The exchange of segments results in the recombination of genetic information. After crossing over, \\neach pair of homologous chromosomes remain as a bivalent.Chromosomes condense further, the nucleoli disappear, and the nuclear envelope disintegrates. Centrioles, which were duplicated during interphase, migrate to the two poles and form spindle fibres. The kinetochore spindle fibres attach with the kinetochores of chromosomes. While the non-kinetochore spindle fibres from both sides interact with each other. Two kinetochore spindle fibres (from the opposite poles) attach with a pair of chromosomes. In mitosis, we have seen that two kinetochore spindle fibres attach with one chromosome.\\nMetaphase I\\nThe pairs of homologous chromosomes align along equatorial plane forming the metaphase plate.\\nAnaphase I\\nKinetochore spindle fibres shorten. It results in pulling apart the chromosomes of each pair. Since one chromosome is pulled toward one pole, two haploid sets are formed. Each chromosome still contains a pair of sister chromatids.\\nTelophase I\\nChromosomes arrive at the poles. Each pole now has half the number of chromosomes but each chromosome still consists of two chromatids. Spindle network disappears, and nuclear envelope is formed around each haploid set. Chromosomes uncoil back into chromatin.\\nCytokinesis (the pinching of the cell membrane in animal cells or the formation of the cell wall in \\nplant cells) occurs and the creation of two haploid daughter cells is completed (Figure 5.9).\\nAfter meiosis I both haploid daughter cells enter a period of rest known as interkinesis  or \\ninterphase II. The interphase II is different from the interphase of mitosis and meiosis I. There is \\nno S-phase and so there is no duplication of chromosomes during this stage.In 1911, the American geneticist Thomas \\nHunt Morgan observed the phenomenon \\nof crossing over in fruit fly Drosophila \\nmelanogaster.\\nDuring crossing over, genetic material is exchanged between sister/non-sister chromatids of homologous /non-homologous chromosomes.Non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes.17\\n5.

Cell Cycle eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1\\nFigure 5.9: Stages in Meiosis-I (b)\\nMeiosis II\\nIt is the second part of meiosis and is similar to mitosis. It is subdivided into prophase II, metaphase \\nII, anaphase II, and telophase II.\\nProphase II takes much less time compared to prophase I. In this prophase, nucleoli and nuclear \\nenvelope disappear and chromatin condenses. Centrioles move to the polar regions and make spindle fibres. In metaphase II, chromosomes attach with kinetochore spindle fibers and align at the equator of cell. \\nThis is followed by  anaphase II, where centromeres are cleaved and sister chromatids are pulled \\napart. The sister chromatids are now called sister chromosomes, and they are pulled toward opposing poles. Telophase II is marked with uncoiling of chromosomes into chromatin. Nuclear envelopes reform; cleavage or cell wall formation eventually produces a total of 4 daughter cells, each with a haploid set of chromosomes (Fig. 5.10).19\\n5. Cell Cycle eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1\\nEach daughter cell has haploid number of chromosomes\\nFigure 5.10: Stages in Meiosis-II20\\n5. Cell Cycle eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.15.3.2 Significance Of Meiosis \\nThe significance of meiosis for reproduction and inheritance was described in 1890 by German \\nbiologist August Weismann. He pointed out that meiosis was necessary not only to maintain the number of chromosomes in the next generation but also to produce variations in next generation.\\nMaintenance of the chromosome number in next generation\\nMeiosis is essential for sexual reproduction. In humans, diploid gamete-mother cells or germ line cells undergo meiosis to produce haploid gametes. Male and female gametes unite to form diploid zygote, which undergoes repeated mitosis and develops into a new diploid human. Many haploid fungi and protozoans produce haploid gametes through mitosis. Plants’ life cycle shows alternation of generations. The cells of diploid sporophyte generation undergo meiosis to produce haploid spores, which grow into haploid gametophyte generations. Gametophyte generation produces haploid gametes through mitosis. The gametes combine to produce diploid zygote. Zygote undergoes repeated mitosis to become diploid sporophyte.\\nProduction of variations in next generations\\nThe chromosome pairs of each parent undergo crossing over during meiosis. So daughter cells i.e. gametes have genetic variations. When gametes fuse and form zygote, its genetic make up is different from both parents. Thus meiosis allows a species to bring variations in the next generations. Beneficial variations help organisms to adapt to the changes in environment.\\nErrors in meiosis   \\nDuring anaphase I, chromosomes separate and go to opposite poles while during anaphase II sister chromosomes separate. It is called disjunction . Sometimes the separation is not normal and it is \\ncalled non-disjunction. This results in the production of gametes which have either more or less \\nthan the normal number of chromosomes. If such abnormal gamete fuses with a normal gamete, it results abnormal chromosome number in next generation, for example 47 or 45 chromosomes in humans.21\\n5. Cell Cycle eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1\\n5.3.3 Comparison Between Mitosis And Meiosis\\nMeiosis II is similar to mitosis while meiosis I makes the actual difference between these two cell \\ndivisions.

Why?\\n5.4 Apoptosis And Necrosis \\nApoptosis and necrosis are two phenomena of cell death.23\\n5. Cell Cycle eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Apoptosis\\nApoptosis is one of the main types of programmed cell death. During apoptosis, cell shrinks and \\nbecomes rounded due to the breakdown of cytoskeleton by enzymes. Its chromatin undergoes condensation and nuclear envelope breaks. In this way, nucleus spreads in the form of several discrete chromatin bodies. Cell membrane makes irregular buds known as blebs. Blebs break off from the \\ncell and are now called apoptotic bodies, which are then phagocytosed by other cells.\\nApoptosis can occur when a cell is damaged or undergoes stress conditions. Apoptosis removes the \\ndamaged cell, preventing it from getting further nutrients, or  to prevent the spread of infections. Apoptosis also gives advantages during development. For example during the formation of fingers, the cells between them undergo apoptosis and the digits separate.\\nNecrosis\\nNecrosis is the accidental death of cells and living tissues. Necrosis is less sequential than apoptosis. There are many causes of necrosis including injury, infection, cancer etc. Necrosis may occur when a cell is given hypoxic (with less oxygen) environments.\\nDuring necrosis, there is a release of special enzymes from lysosomes. Lysosomal enzymes break \\ncellular components and may also be released outside cell to break surrounding cells. Cells that die by necrosis may also release harmful chemicals that damage other cells.\\nSpider bites also cause necrosis in\\nsome areas.Necrosis may be due to lack of\\nproper care to a wound site.In an adult human,50 to 70 billion cells die each day by apoptosis.24\\n5.

Enzymes eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1The life of living organisms is a reflection of what is going on in their bodies. Metabolism is the set of \\nbiochemical reactions that occur in living organisms in order to maintain life.These processes allow organisms to grow and reproduce maintain their structures, and respond to their environments. Anabolism includes the biochemical reactions in which larger molecules are synthesized while catabolism includes the biochemical reactions in which larger molecules are broken down. Usually, energy is released in catabolism and it is utilized in anabolism. In this way the biochemical reactions are actually energy transfers. During metabolism, chemicals are transformed from one form to the other by enzymes. Enzymes are crucial to metabolism because they act as biocatalysts  \\nand speed up and regulate metabolic pathways.\\nThe term metabolism is derived from a Greek word meaning “change . The concept of metabolism was first of all given by Ibn-e-Nafees, who stated that “the body and its parts are always undergoing change.\\nEnzymes are proteins that catalyze (i.e. speed up) biochemical reactions and are not changed during the reaction. The molecules at which enzymes act are called substrates, and enzyme converts \\nthem into different molecules, called products.\\nAll chemical reactions require activation energy. It is defined as minimum energy required to start \\na reaction. The need for activation energy acts as a barrier to the beginning of reaction as symbolized in the diagram). Enzymes lower such barriers by decreasing the requirement of activation energy. Thus, in the presence of enzymes, reactions proceed at a faster rate (Figure 6.1)\\nEnzymes lower the activation energy in several ways. They may alter the shape of substrate and \\nreduce the requirement of energy for this change. Some enzymes do so by disrupting the charge distribution on substrates. Enzymes may also lower activation energy by bringing substrates in the correct orientation to react.\\n3\\n6. Enzymes eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1All biochemical catalysts are not proteins for example some RNA molecules also catalyze reactions.\\nFigure 6.1: Enzymes lower the activation energy\\nEnzymes can be categorized on the basis of the site where they work i.e. they may be intracellular \\nenzymes (e.g. enzymes of glycolysis working in the cytoplasm) or may be extracellular enzymes \\n(e.g. pepsin enzyme working in the stomach cavity)\\nstatement 1: All enzymes are catalysts.Statement 2: All catalysts are \\nenzymes.Which one is correct? Statement 14\\n6. Enzymes eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.16.1 Characteristics Of Enzymes\\nIn 1878, German physiologist Winhelm Kuhne first used the term enzyme. Enzymes are globular \\nproteins Like all proteins, enzymes are made of long linear chains of amino acids that fold to produce \\na three-dimensional molecule. •\\n Almost all enzymes are proteins i.e. they are made of amino acids. \\n•\\n Most \\nenzyme reaction rates are millions of times faster than those of comparable uncatalyzed \\nreactions. As with all catalysts, enzymes are not consumed by the reactions they catalyze.\\n•\\n Enzymes \\nare usually very specific for the type of reaction and for the nature of their substrates.\\n•\\n Only \\na small portion of enzyme molecule is directly involved in catalysis. This catalytic region is \\nknown as  active site It recognizes and binds substrate and then carries out reaction.\\n•\\n Enzyme \\nproduction can be enhanced or diminished by a cell according to needs. Enzyme activity  \\ncan also be regulated by inhibitors  and activators.\\n•\\n Some \\nenzymes do not need any additional component to work. However, others require non-\\nprotein molecules or ions called cofactors . Cofactors can be either inorganic (e.g. metal ions) or \\norganic (e.g. flavin and heme).If organic cofactors are tightly bound to enzyme, they are called prosthetic groups. If organic cofactors are loosely attached with enzyme, they are called co-\\nenzymes. Coenzymes transport chemical groups from one enzyme to another. Some important vitamins (e.g. riboflavin, thiamine and folic acid) act as coenzymes.\\n•\\n Several \\nenzymes can work together in a specific order, creating metabolic pathways In a \\nmetabolic pathway, one enzyme takes the product of another enzyme as a substrate. After the reaction, the product is passed on to the next enzyme.\\nAnimation 6.1: Enzyme  \\nSource & Credit: dynamicscience5\\n6. Enzymes eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Uses of enzymes\\nEnzymes are extensively used in different industries for fast chemical reactions. For example;\\n1.\\n Food industry:  \\nEnzymes that break starch into simple sugars are used in the production of \\nwhite bread, buns etc.\\n2.\\n Brewing industry:\\n Enzymes break starch and proteins. The products are used by yeast for \\nfermentation (to produce alcohol).\\n3.\\n Paper industry: \\nEnzymes break starch to lower its viscosity that aids in making paper.\\n4.\\n Biological \\ndetergent: Protease enzymes are used for the removal of protein stains from clothes. \\nAmylase enzymes are used in dish washing to remove resistant starch residues.\\n6.1.1 Factors Affecting The Rate Of Enzyme Action\\nEnzymes are very sensitive to the environment in which they work. Any factor that can change the chemistry or shape of enzyme molecule, can affect its activity. Some of the factors that can affect the rate of enzyme action are being discussed next.\\nTemperature\\nIncrease in temperature speeds up the rate of enzyme catalyzed reactions, but only to a point (Figure 6.2). Every enzyme works at its maximum rate at a specific temperature called as the optimum \\ntemperature for that enzyme.\\nWhen temperature rises to a certain limit, heat adds in the activation energy and also provides \\nkinetic energy for the reaction. So reactions are accelerated. But when temperature is raised well above the optimum temperature, heat energy increases the vibrations of atoms of enzyme and the globular structure of enzyme is lost. This is known as the denaturation  of enzyme. It results in a \\nrapid decrease in rate of enzyme action and it may be blocked completely.\\nThe optimum temperature for the maximum working speed of human enzymes is 37oC.6\\n6. Enzymes eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1\\nFigure 6.2: Effect of temperature on enzyme activity\\nFigure 6.3: Effect of substrate concentration on enzyme activityBirds have higher body temperature than mammals.What would happen to the \\nactivity of a bird’s enzyme if it is given temperature of 37o C?Reaction will slow down\\nSubstrate concentration\\nIf enzyme molecules are available in a reaction, increase in substrate concentration increases the rate of reaction. If enzyme concentration is kept constant and amount of substrate is increased, a point is reached where any further increase in substrate does not increase the rate of reaction any more. When the active sites of all enzymes are occupied (at high substrate concentration), any more substrate molecules do not find free active sites. This state is called saturation  of active sites and reaction \\nrate does not increase (Figure 6.3).7\\n6. Enzymes eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1pH\\nAll enzymes work at their maximum rate at a narrow range of pH, called as the optimum pH \\n(Figure 6.4). A slight change in this pH causes retardation in enzyme activity or blocks it completely. \\nEvery enzyme has its specific optimum pH value. For example pepsin (working in stomach) is active in acidic medium (low pH) while trypsin (working in small intestine) shows its activity in alkaline medium (high pH). Change in pH can affect the ionization of the amino acids at the active site.\\n6.2 Mechanism Of Enzyme Action\\nWhen enzyme attaches with substrate, a temporary enzyme-substrate (ES) complex is formed. Enzyme catalyzes the reaction and substrate is transformed into product. After it, the ES complex breaks and enzyme and product are released.\\nIn order to explain the mechanism of enzyme action a German chemist Emil Fischer, in 1894, \\nproposed lock and key model. According to this model, both enzyme and substrate possess \\nspecific shapes that fit exactly into one another. This model explains enzyme specificity (Figure 6.5).\\nFigure 6.4: Effect of pH on enzyme activity\\n8\\n6. Enzymes eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1In 1958, an American biologist Daniel Koshland  suggested a modification to lock and key model \\nand proposed induced-fit model. According to this model, active site is not a rigid structure rather \\nit is molded into the required shape to perform its function. Induced fit model is more acceptable \\nthan “lock and key” model of enzyme action.\\n6.3 Specificity Of Enzymes\\nThere are over 2000 known enzymes, each of which is involved in one specific chemical reaction. Enzymes are also substrate specific. The enzyme protease (which breaks peptide bonds in proteins) will not work on starch (which is broken down by an enzyme amylase . Similarly lipase enzyme acts only on lipids and digests them into fatty acids and glycerol. Specificity of different enzymes is determined by the shapes of their active sites. Active sites possess specific geometric shapes that fit with specific substrates.\\nFigure 6.5: Lock and key model of enzyme action\\nFigure 6.6: Induced-Fit model of enzyme action9\\n6. Enzymes eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1See in Figure 6.7 how the geometric shape of active site of enzyme determines its specificity for \\nsubstrate (point out which substrate can exactly fit in the active site).\\nPractical Work:\\nPerform an experiment to show the working of an enzyme in vitro\\nEnzymes can catalyze in-vivo and in-vitro reactions. We can design an experiment to observe the in-vitro enzyme activity.

Inside cells, substances are broken down and new substances are formed. Energy drives all these processes in a cell. In living organisms, energy exists in two forms: kinetic energy is actively involved in doing work, and potential energy is stored for future use. Potential energy is stored in chemical bonds and is released as kinetic energy when these bonds break.\\n7.1 Bioenergetics And The Role Of ATP  \\nBioenergetics is the study of energy relationships and energy transformations (conversions) in living organisms. Organisms obtain energy by metabolizing the food they eat or prepare. Food contains potential energy in its bonds. When these bonds are broken down, a large amount of kinetic energy is usually released. Some of this energy is stored in the form of potential energy in the bonds of ATP molecules while the rest escapes as heat. The potential energy stored in ATP is again transformed into kinetic energy to carry out life activities (Fig 7.1).\\nRecalling\\nPlants and some microorganisms (e.g. photosynthetic bacteria and algae) prepare their \\nown food from carbon dioxide and water in the presence of light by a process called \\nphotosynthesis. Whereas animals, fungi and many microorganisms (non-photosynthetic \\nbacteria and protozoans) get the prepared food.3\\n7. Bioenergetics eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Oxidation-Reduction Reaction\\nVarious life processes in organisms involve constant flow of energy. This energy flow comprises the \\nacquisition, transformation and use of energy for various life processes like growth, movement, reproduction etc.\\nFor all life processes, oxidation-reduction reactions (redox reactions) are the direct source of \\nenergy. Redox reactions involve exchange of electrons between atoms. The loss of electrons is called oxidation  while the gain of electrons is called reduction .\\nElectrons can be an energy source. It depends upon their location and arrangement in atoms. For example; when they are present in oxygen, they make stable association with oxygen atom and are not good energy source. But if electrons are dragged away from oxygen and attached to some Animation 7.2 : Bioenergetic\\nSource and Credit: introbiol4\\n7. Bioenergetics eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1other atom e.g. carbon or hydrogen, they make unstable association. They try to move back to \\noxygen and when this happens, energy is released.\\nIn living organisms redox reactions involve the loss and gain of hydrogen atoms. We know that \\na hydrogen atom contains one proton and one electron. It means that when a molecule loses a hydrogen atom, it actually loses an electron (oxidation) and similarly when a molecule gains hydrogen atom, it actually gains an electron (reduction).\\nFigure 7.1: Some energy transformations in living organisms.\\nNote that heat is lost in every transformation5\\n7. Bioenergetics eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1\\nFigure 7.2: Redox reactionsATP was discovered in 1929 by Karl Lohmann,  \\nand was proposed to be the main energy-transfer \\nmolecule in the cell by the Nobel prize winner, Fritz Lipmann in 1941.\\nATP: The Cell’s Energy Currency\\nThe major energy currency of all cells is a nucleotide called adenosine triphosphate (ATP). It is the main energy source for majority of the cellular functions like synthesis of macromolecules (DNA, RNA, and proteins), movement, transmission of nerve impulses, active transport, exocytosis and endocytosis etc.\\nThe ability of ATP to store and release energy is due to its molecular structure. Figure 7.3 shows \\na simplified diagram of ATP. Each ATP molecule has three subunits: (a) adenine - a double-ringed nitrogenous base; (b) a ribose - a five-carbon sugar; and (c) three phosphate groups in a linear chain.\\nThe ability of ATP to store and release energy is due to its molecular structure.

Bioenergetics eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1\\nFigure 7.3: Molecular structure of ATPThe covalent bond connecting two phosphates is indicated by the “tilde” (~) and it is a high-energy \\nbond. The energy in this bond is released as it breaks and inorganic phosphate (Pi) gets separated from ATP. The breaking of one phosphate bond releases about 7.3 kcal (7,300 calories) per mole of ATP as follows:\\nATP + H\\n2O g ADP + Pi + energy (7.3 \\nkcal/mole)\\nIn common energy reactions only the outermost of the two high-energy bonds breaks. When this happens, ATP becomes ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and one Pi is released. In some cases, ADP is further broken down to AMP (adenosine monophosphate) and P as follows:\\nADP + H\\n2O g AMP + Pi + energy (7.3 \\nkcal/mole)\\nCells constantly recycle ADP by recombining it with Pi to form ATP.The synthesis of ATP from ADP \\nand Pi requires the expenditure of 7.3 kcal of energy per mole. This energy is obtained from the \\noxidation of foodstuff. So we can summarize that ATP is generated by energy-releasing processes and is broken down by energy-consuming processes. In this way ATP transfers energy between metabolic reactions.\\n7.2 Photosynthesis  \\nPhotosynthesis is the synthesis of glucose from carbon dioxide and water in the presence of sunlight and chlorophyll, with oxygen as a by-product. Photosynthesis is an anabolic (building) process and is an important component of bioenergetics in living systems.Because ATP plays a central role as energy currency in all organisms, it must have appeared in the early history of life.7\\n7. Bioenergetics eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1It is the most important biochemical pathway and nearly all life depends on it. It comprises many \\ncoordinated biochemical reactions that occur in plants, some protists (algae), and some bacteria. A simple general equation for photosynthesis is as follows:\\nAnimation 7.3 : Photosynthesis\\nSource and Credit: agarciahawkins.weeblyWhen cells use energy to build ATP from ADP, or ADP from AMP, they are really storing energy as we put money in a bank8\\n7.

Plants have mechanisms for \\nthe intake and transport of these raw materials. \\nWater, present in soil, is absorbed by roots and root hairs through osmosis. This water is eventually \\ntransported to leaves through xylem vessels.\\nThe air that enters leaf through tiny pores (stomata) reaches into the air spaces present around \\nmesophyll cells. This air carries CO2 , which gets absorbed in the thin layer of  water surrounding \\nmesophyll cells. From here, the carbon dioxide diffuses into mesophyll cells.\\nRecalling\\nOsmosis is the movement of water from a dilute \\nsolution to the concentrated one, through a \\nmembrane.\\nAnimation 7.5 : Photosynthesis\\nSource and Credit: solpass10\\n7. Bioenergetics eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.17.2.1 Mechanism Of Photosynthesis\\nPhotosynthesis occurs in two phases (Fig 7.4). During first phase, light energy is captured and is \\nused to make high-energy molecules (ATP and NADPH). These reactions, which are known as light reactions , take place on the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts. During second phase, carbon \\ndioxide is reduced to make glucose. In this phase, the energy from high energy molecules (ATP andNADPH) is utilized. Since these reactions do not use light directly, they are known as dark reactions.Animation 7.6 : Photosynthesis\\nSource and Credit: cas.miamioh11\\n7.

The hydrogen atoms of \\nwater give electrons to chlorophyll and become ions.\\n•\\n The electrons of chlorophyll, \\nafter the production of ATP, and the hydrogen ions of water are \\nused for the reduction of NADP+ into NADPH.\\nThe whole series of light reactions is called Z-scheme due to its Z-shaped flow chart.         \\nFigure 7.5: Light reactions of photosynthesis13\\n7.

The 3-carbon carbohydrates are used to manufacture glucose.\\n•\\n The \\n3-carbon carbohydrates are also used to regenerate the original 5-carbon compounds. This \\nstep also utilizes ATP.\\n7.2.2 Role Of Chlorophyll And Light\\nSunlight energy is absorbed by chlorophyll. It is then converted into chemical energy, which drives the \\nphotosynthetic process. Only about one percent of the light falling on the leaf surface is absorbed, the rest is reflected or transmitted. The light rays of different wavelengths are not only differently absorbed by photosynthetic pigments but are also differently effective in photosynthesis. The blue and red lights carry out more photosynthesis. \\nFigure 7.6: Dark reactions of photosynthesis (The Calvin cycle)15\\n7. Bioenergetics eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1\\nCalvin was awarded Nobel prize, in \\n1961, for his work on the details of photosynthesis.Photosynthetic pigments are organized in the form of clusters, called photosystems, in thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts. Chlorophyll-a is the main photosynthetic pigment. Others are called accessory pigments and include chlorophyll-b and carotenoids. Chlorophylls absorb mainly blue and red lights. Some wavelengths not absorbed by chlorophyll ‘a’ are very effectively absorbed by accessory pigments and vice-versa.\\n7.2.3 Limiting Factors In Photosynthesis  \\nAny environmental factor the absence or deficiency of which can decrease the rate of a metabolic reaction, is called limiting factor for that reaction. Many factors like light intensity, temperature, concentration of carbon dioxide and availability of water act as limiting factors for photosynthesis.\\nEffect of light intensity and temperature\\nThe rate of photosynthesis varies with light intensity. It decreases as light intensity decreases and increases as intensity increases. However at much higher light intensity, the rate of photosynthesis becomes constant.\\nIn dark reactions, 3-carbon compounds are reduced to form carbohydrates. What is the ultimate source of these hydrogen for this reduction?Water16\\n7. Bioenergetics eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1The rate of photosynthesis decreases with decrease in temperature. It increases as temperature \\nis increased over a limited range. But if light intensity is low, increasing the temperature has little influence on the rate of photosynthesis.\\nEffect of carbon dioxide concentration\\nAs carbon dioxide concentration rises, the rate of photosynthesis goes on increasing until limited by other factors. Increase in carbon dioxide concentration beyond a certain level causes the closure of stomata and it decreases the rate of photosynthesis.\\nPractical Work:\\nDemonstration of photosynthesisThe phenomenon of photosynthesis can be demonstrated by using an aquatic plant, like HydriIla. You know that in the process of photosynthesis, oxygen gas is evolved as a byproduct.So release of oxygen from a set up would provide an evidence of photosynthesis.Problem: Does Hydrilla carry out photosynthesis when provided by all the essential factors?Hypothesis: Hydrilla is an aquatic plant that carries out photosynthesis, using CO\\n2 and  water and releases \\noxygen at the same time.Deduction: Release of O\\n2 from the plant body would be a proof of photosynthesis. \\nMaterial required: Fresh Hydrilla branches, 500 ml beaker, funnel, test tube, potassium bicarbonate, match box, water tub.Background information: Carbon dioxide and water are the raw materials for photosynthesis.

Take a burning match-stick inside the tube. It flares up when it touches gas bubbles. It confirms that the test tube contains oxygen gas.Error analysis: The experimental work would not give the expected results if any of the limiting factors of photosynthesis i.e. light, CO\\n2 , water, and chlorophyll are not present. \\nSimilarly, if gas bubbles are not observed the branches used may be dead and decayed.Evaluation:1.\\n There are two phases of photosynthesis i.e. light reactions and dark reactions.During which of these phases oxygen is produced?\\n2.\\n Why \\nwas it necessary to do experiment with fresh \\nbranches of Hydrilla?\\n3.\\n Why did you use a burning match-stick for confirmatory test?\\n4.\\n What products (other than oxygen) are produced during photosynthesis?\\nFigure 7.7: Experiment set up for the demonstration of \\nphotosynthesis18\\n7.

In many plants the synthesized glucose is converted into starch. So presence of starch in a leaf confirms that the plant has carried out photosynthesis. The presence of starch is investigated through starch test.Problem: How would it be proved that starch is present in a leaf?Hypothesis: A fresh leaf has carried out photosynthesis and has accumulated starch in its cell.Deduction: If the experimental leaf is processed for starch test, it would give positive results for starch.Material required: Fresh leaves, a 500 ml beaker, a forceps, a test tube, ethanol, dilute iodine solution, dropper, petri dish.Background information:•\\n When a leaf is dipped in boiling water for sometime, it is killed and becomes soft.\\n•\\n A \\nsoft and decolourized leaf can be tested in starch test.

In the same way, organisms utilize oxygen for the breakdown of C-H bonds present in the food in their cells. This break down yields energy which is transformed into ATP. During this process the C-H bonds are broken by oxidation-reduction reaction and so carbon dioxide and water are also produced. The cellular energy-yielding process is called cellular respiration.\\nThere are more chloroplasts in the palisade mesophyll than in the spongy mesophyll. Why?Because the palisade cells are on the upper surface and\\nreceive more light. So they should be able to absorb more light.25\\n7. Bioenergetics eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1In cellular respiration, food is oxidized to CO2 while O2 is  reduced into H2O.\\n7.3.1 Aerobic And Anaerobic Respiration  \\nThe most common fuel used by cell to get energy by cellular resp ration is glucose. The way glucose \\nis oxidized depends on the availability of oxygen. The cellular respiration occurring in the presence of oxygen is called aerobic respiration while the one that occurs in the absence of oxygen is called anaerobic respiration.\\ni. Aerobic Respiration\\nIn the presence of oxygen, complete oxidation of glucose occurs with maximum release of energy. In the first phase of aerobic respiration, a molecule of glucose (6-C) is broken down into two molecules of pyruvic acid (3-C). In the second phase, molecules of pyruvic acid are completely oxidized (all C-H bonds are broken) to CO\\n2 and water and all energy is released.The overall reaction is as follows.\\nii. Anaerobic Respiration (Fermentation)\\nIn the absence of oxygen, glucose is incompletely oxidized with less amount of energy released. In anaerobic respiration, the first phase is exactly similar to that of aerobic respiration. A molecule of glucose is broken down into two molecules of pyruvic acid. But in the second phase, pyruvic acid is not completely oxidized (due to the absence of oxygen).\\nAnimation 7.10 : Anaerobic Respiration\\nSource and Credit: biobook.kuensting26\\n7. Bioenergetics eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1 It is transformed into ethyl alcohol or lactic acid. In this way many of the C-H bonds are left \\nunbroken in the products. Anaerobic respiration is further classified as alcoholic fermentation and lactic acid fermentation.\\nA- Alcoholic fermentation:\\nIt occurs in bacteria, yeast etc. In this type of anaerobic respiration, pyruvic acid is further broken down into alcohol (C\\n2H5 OH) and CO2 .\\nB- Lactic acid fermentation:\\nIt occurs in skeletal muscles of humans and other animals during extreme physical activities. This also happens in the bacteria present in milk. In this type of anaerobic respiration, each pyruvic acid molecule is converted into lactic acid (C\\n2H6O3 ).\\nImportance of Fermentation\\nWhen life evolved on the Earth, the early land or water habitats did not have any supply of free oxygen (O\\n2). In these anaerobic conditions, early organisms respired anaerobically and \\ngot energy for their life activities. Even today when free oxygen is available, some organisms including some bacteria and some fungi get energy from anaerobic respiration and are called anaerobes. Humans can also provide energy to their skeletal muscle cells through anaerobic respiration. It happens when skeletal muscles have to work hard (during exercise etc.) but oxygen supply cannot be increased to fulfil the demand.\\nScientists have used the fermenting abilities of fungi and bacteria for the benefit of mankind. \\nFor example, the fermenting powers of bacteria are used for making cheese and yogurt. Fermentation in yeasts is used in brewing and baking industries. Similarly, the soy sauce is made through the fermentation by a fungus Aspergillus.27\\n7. Bioenergetics eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.17.3.2 Mechanism Of Respiration  \\nThe process of respiration involves complex series of reactions. For the study of all the reactions \\nof glucose oxidation, we will go into the mechanism of aerobic respiration. Aerobic respiration is a continuous process, but for convenience we can divide it into three main stages; 1- glycolysis, 2- Krebs cycle and 3- electron transport chain. \\nGlycolysis  occurs in cytoplasm and oxygen is not involved in this stage. That is why, it occurs in \\nboth types of respiration i.e. aerobic and anaerobic. In glycolysis, glucose (6C) molecule is broken \\ninto two molecules of pyruvic acid (3C). \\nIn Krebs cycle, the pyruvic acid molecules are completely oxidized, along with the formation of \\nATP, NADH and FADH\\n2 . Before entering in Krebs cycle, pyruvic acid is changed into a 2-carbon \\ncompound called acetyl-CoA.\\nElectron transport chain  is the final step of cellular respiration. It is the transfer of electron on an \\nelectron transport chain. In this step, NADH and FADH2 release electrons and hydrogen ions. These \\nelectrons are taken up by a series of electron carriers. When electrons move through the series of \\nelectron carriers they lose energy, which is used to synthesize ATP. At the end of chain, electrons and hydrogen ions combine with molecular oxygen and form water.\\n                                                                 \\nWhy it is incorrect to say that the energy releasing step \\nof respiration is electron transport chain?Energy released in glycolysis and kerbs cycle in the form \\nof NADH and FADH2. Electron transport chain transforms \\nthe energy present in these components to ATP.28\\n7. Bioenergetics eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1\\nFigure 7.12: Mechanism of respiration\\n7.3.3 The Energy Budget Of Respiration\\nEach NADH produces 3 ATP in electron transport \\nchain. The NADH generated in glycolysis gives 2 ATP because 1 ATP is spent to transport it across the mitochondrial membrane. Each FADH\\n2 produces \\n2 ATP. The total output of ATPs can be calculated from the following data (Fig 7.13). Note that during anaerobic oxidation of a glucose molecule only 2 ATP molecules are gained as the net profit. It is because there is no Krebs cycle and electron transport chain in anaerobic respiration.A British biochemist, Sir Hans Krebs \\ndiscovered this series of reactions that is \\nwhy it is called the Krebs cycle.29\\n7.

Nutrition eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Recalling\\nEvery organism needs food for growth and energy and to function normally. \\nThe process in which food is obtained or prepared, absorbed and converted into body substances \\nfor growth and energy, is called nutrition. Nutrients are the elements and compounds that an organism obtains and uses for energy or for the synthesis of new materials.\\nWe know that autotrophic organisms obtain water, carbon dioxide and minerals from their \\nenvironment and prepare their food which is then used for growth and energy. On the other hand \\nheterotrophic organisms obtain their food from other organisms and use it for growth and energy.\\n8.1 MINERAL NUTRITION IN PLANTS\\nPlants have the most efficient mechanisms for autotrophic mode of nutrition. Plants get carbon, hydrogen and oxygen from carbon dioxide and water. In addition to these elements, plants also require mineral elements for various activities and structures. The nutrients which are required in large quantities are called macronutrients  e.g. carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, \\nmagnesium, potassium etc. Similarly, the nutrients which are required in small quantities are called micronutrients e.g. iron, molybdenum, boron, chlorine, zinc etc. If any of these nutrients is not \\navailable to plant, they show abnormalities and do not grow normally. Table 8.1 describes the roles of important macro and micronutrients in plants.3\\n8. Nutrition eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Animation 8.2: Nutritions\\nSource & Credit: spokaneschools4\\n8.

Nutrition eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Roles of Nitrogen and Magnesium\\nPlants get nitrogen in the form of nitrates. Nitrogen is a major component of proteins, hormones, \\nchlorophyll, vitamins and enzymes essential for plant life. Nitrogen metabolism is a major factor in stem and leaf growth. Too much nitrogen can delay flowering and fruiting. Deficiencies of nitrogen can reduce yields, cause yellowing of the leaves and stunt growth.\\nMagnesium is a structural component of chlorophyll. It is also necessary for the functioning of \\nplant enzymes to produce carbohydrates, sugars and fats. It is used for fruit and nut formation and essential for germination of seeds. Deficiency of magnesium causes yellowing and wilting of leaves.\\nIMPORTANCE OF FERTILIZERS\\nAs humans cultivated plants, it was learned that addition of certain materials to soil sometimes resulted in plants with desirable characteristics (e.g., more fruit, faster growth, more attractive flowers). Such materials were named as fertilizers. Fertilizers are broadly classified as organic or inorganic.\\nNaturally occurring inorganic fertilizers include rock phosphate, elemental sulfur and gypsum. These \\nare not chemically modified. If nitrogen is the main element, they are called nitrogen fertilizers. Most inorganic fertilizers dissolve readily in water and are immediately available to plants for uptake.\\nOrganic fertilizers are derived from plant and animal materials. They are more complex and take \\ntime to be broken down into forms usable by plants. Manure and compost are used as organic fertilizers. They can also increase soil drainage, aeration and the ability of the soil to hold nutrients.\\nThe distinction between the organic and inorganic fertilizers is not always clear-cut. Urea, for \\nexample, is an organic compound, but chemically synthesized urea is generally grouped with \\ninorganic fertilizers.Carnivorous plants have evolved mechanisms for trapping and digesting small animals. The \\nproducts of this digestion are used to supplement the plant’s supply of nitrogen.7\\n8. Nutrition eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Environmental hazards related to fertilizer's use\\nThe massive quantities of inorganic fertilizers affect the soil nutrient-holding capacity. Their high \\nsolubilities also degrade ecosystems through eutrophication  (increase in chemical nutrientsin \\nan ecosystem). Storage and application of some nitrogen fertilizers may cause emissions of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide. Ammonia gas may be emitted from the inorganic fertilizers. This extra ammonia can also increase soil acidity. Excessive nitrogen fertilizers can lead to pest problems by increasing their reproduction rate.\\nFor these reasons, it is recommended that the nutrient content of the soil and nutrient requirements \\nof the crop should be calculated before the application of inorganic fertilizers. \\nExcessive amounts of organic fertilizers cause environmental problems due to nitrate leaching or \\nrun off of soluble organic compounds.Animation 8.4: Importance of Fertilizers\\nSource & Credit: boerenbritaccommodation8\\n8. Nutrition eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.18.2 COMPONENTS OF HUMAN FOOD\\nThe nutritional requirements of human and other animals are relatively complex as compared to \\nplants. Like other animals, the nutrients used by humans include carbohydrates, lipids, nucleic acids, proteins, minerals, vitamins. Besides these nutrients, they also require water.\\nCARBOHYDRATES\\nCarbohydrates are the basic source of energy for all animals. About half to 2/3 of the total calories every animal consumes daily are from carbohydrates. Glucose is the most often used carbohydrate for energy. Other useful carbohydrates are maltose, lactose, sucrose and starch. Carbohydrates contain 04 kilocalories per gram. Humans get carbohydrates from the foods like bread, pastas, beans, potatoes, bran, rice and cereals.\\nCarbohydrates are the most common source of energy. Proteins and lipids are vital building \\ncomponents for body but they can also be used for energy.\\nSaturated fatty acids can increase a person’s cholesterol level. An increased cholesterol level \\nmay eventually result in the clogging of arteries and, ultimately, heart disease.\\nIf we supply inorganic and organic fertilizers to a plant, which one would be first available to the plant for uptake?Inorganic fertilizer9\\n8. Nutrition eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1LIPIDS\\nThe lipids present in food are composed of fatty acids bonded to glycerol. The fatty acids of lipids \\nmay be saturated or unsaturated.\\nSaturated fatty acids have all of their carbon atoms bonded to hydrogen atoms.\\nUnsaturated fatty acids have some of their carbon atoms double-bonded in place of a hydrogen \\natom. Generally, the lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature. The lipids containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. For example butter contains nearly 70% saturated and 30% unsaturated fatty acids. On the other hand, sunflower oil contains nearly 75% unsaturated fatty acids. Lipids are used to form membranes, the sheaths surrounding neurons, and certain hormones. Lipids are also extremely useful energy sources. One gram of lipids contains 09 kilocalories of energy. Important sources of lipids include milk, butter, cheese, eggs, mutton, fish,mustard seeds, coconut and dry fruits etc\\nPROTEINS\\nProteins are composed of amino acids. Proteins are essential components of the cytoplasm, membranes and organelles. They are also the major components of muscles, ligaments, and tendons. So we use proteins for growth. Many proteins play role as enzymes. Proteins can also be used for gaining energy. One gram of proteins contains 04 kilocalories of energy. Dietary sources of proteins are meat, eggs, grains, legumes, and dairy products such as milk and cheese.\\nProteins can be converted into carbohydrates\\nMINERALS\\nMinerals are inorganic elements that originate in the Earth and cannot be made in body. They play important roles in various body functions and are necessary to maintain health. Most of the minerals in human diet come directly from plants and water, or indirectly from animal foods. Minerals are categorized into major and trace minerals. Major minerals are required in the amounts of 100 mg (milligrams) or more per day, while trace minerals are required in amounts less than 100 mg per \\nday. The roles of major and minor minerals in human body are given in Table 8.2.\\nOn the nutritional label of a packaged food the word “Calorie” is equal to a kilocalorie.10\\n8. Nutrition eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Table 8.2: Important minerals in human diet and their roles\\nMineralsRole in bodyMajor minerals\\nSodiumFluid balance in the body \\nHelps in absorption of other nutrients Important for muscle contraction, nerve impulsetransmission, heart function, and blood pressurePotassiumFluid balance in the body Acts as cofactor for enzymes\\nChlorideFluid balance in the body Component of hydrochloric acid\\nCalcium Development and maintenance of bones and teeth blood clotting\\nMagnesium &PhosphorusDevelopment and maintenance of bones and teeth\\nTrace minerals\\nIron Oxygen transport and storageAct as enzyme cofactors support immune function ZincAids insulin actionHelps in growth and reproduction\\nCopper Acts as enzyme cofactor\\nChromium Helps in insulin action\\nFluoride Stabilizes bone mineral and hardens tooth enamel\\nIodine Essential for normal thyroid function\\nRole of Calcium and Iron\\nCalcium is essential for the development and maintenance of bones and teeth. It is also needed for maintaining cell membranes and connective tissues and for the activation of several enzymes. Calcium also aids in blood clotting. Humans get calcium from milk, cheese, egg yolk, beans, nuts, cabbage etc. Deficiency of calcium causes spontaneous discharge of nerve impulses which may result in tetany, bones also become soft, blood clots slowly and wounds heal slowly.\\nIron plays a major role in oxygen transport and storage. It is a component of haemoglobin in red \\nblood cells and myoglobin in muscle cells. Cellular energy production also requires iron. It acts as cofactor for many enzymes of cellular respiration. Iron also supports immune function. Humans get iron from red meat, egg yolk, whole wheat, fish, spinach, mustard etc. Its deficiency is the most common nutrient deficiency worldwide. Iron-deficiency causes anaemia.11\\n8. Nutrition eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Good calcium nutrition, along with low salt and high potassium intake, prevents from \\nhypertension and kidney stones.\\nVITAMINS\\nVitamins are the chemical compounds that are required in low amounts but are essential for \\nnormal growth and metabolism. Vitamins may be divided into two groups: the fat-soluble vitamins (vitamins A, D, E, and K) and the water-soluble vitamins (vitamins B and vitamin C).\\nVitamin A\\nVitamin A was the first fat-soluble vitamin identified (in 1913). It combines with a protein called opsin to form rhodopsin in rod cells of the retina of eye. When vitamin A is inadequate, the lack of rhodopsin makes it difficult to see in dim light. It is also involved in cell differentiation, a process through which embryonic cells transform into mature cells with specific functions. Vitamin A also supports bone growth and immune function\\nCooking or heating destroys the water soluble vitamins more readily than the fat-soluble \\nvitamins.\\nFat-soluble vitamins are much less excreted from the body as compared to water-soluble \\nvitamins. This means that levels of water-soluble vitamins in the body can decrease more \\nquickly, leading to vitamin deficiency.\\nWhich of the major components of food is needed as the main structural componet of the bodyproteins12\\n8.

One of the symptoms of vitamin-A deficiency is night blindness. It is a temporary \\ncondition, but if left untreated it can cause permanent blindness. Vitamin-A deficiency can also cause a condition in which hair follicles become plugged with keratin, giving dry texture to skin.\\nVitamin C: (Ascorbic Acid)\\nVitamin C participates in many reactions. It is needed to form collagen (a fibrous protein) that gives strength to connective tissues. Collagen is also needed for the healing of wounds. Vitamin C in white blood cells enables the immune system to function properly.13\\n8. Nutrition eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1We get vitamin C from citrus fruits (e.g. oranges, lemons, and grape fruit), leafy green vegetables, \\nbeef liver etc. Deficiency of vitamin C causes connective tissue changes throughout the body. The disease known as scurvy results from lack of vitamin C. In this condition the synthesized collagen is unstable. Symptoms of scurvy include muscle and joint pain, swollen and bleeding gums, slow wounds healing, and dry skin.\\nVitamin D\\nThe best-known function of vitamin D is to help regulate blood levels of calcium and phosphorous. Vitamin D increases the absorption of these minerals from intestine and their deposition in bones. Vitamin D is mainly found in fish liver oil, milk, ghee, and butter etc. It is also synthesized by skin when ultraviolet (UV) radiations from the Sun are used to convert a compound into vitamin D. Long-term deficiency of vitamin D affects bones. In children, vitamin-D deficiency leads to rickets, \\na condition in which bones weaken and bow under pressure. In adults, vitamin-D deficiency causes osteomalacia , or “softening of bones,”increasing the risk for fractures in bones.\\nPractical work: Tests for starch (iodine test); reducing sugars (Benedict’s test); protein (Biuret test); and lipids (ethanol emulsion test).

Nutrition eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Analyzing and Interpreting\\nInvestigate your daily food intake and present it in a tabulated data form (in terms of nutrients and \\ncalories).\\n8.2.1 EFFECTS OF WATER AND DIETARY FIBRE\\nStrictly speaking, water and dietary fibre are not considered as nutrients, but they do play important \\nrole in life.\\nWATER\\nApproximately 60% of the adult human body is composed of water. Nearly all life sustaining chemical reactions require an aqueous (watery) environment. Water also functions as the environment in which water-soluble foodstuff is absorbed in the intestines and the waste products are eliminated in urine. Another essential role of water is to maintain body temperature through evaporation, as in sweating. Severe dehydration may result in cardiovascular problems. The estimated water requirement of an average adult is two litres per day. Important sources of daily water intake are natural water, milk, juicy fruits and vegetables.\\nDIETARY FIBRE\\nDietary fibre (also known as “roughage”) is the part of human food that is indigestible. It is found only in plant foods and it moves undigested through stomach and small intestine and into colon. The insoluble dietary fibre travels quickly through small intestines. Its sources are wheat bran, \\ncereals and skins of many fruits and vegetables. The soluble dietary fibre breaks down as it passes \\nthrough alimentary canal. Its sources are oats, beans, barley, and many fruits and vegetables.\\nFibre prevents and relieves constipation by stimulating the contraction of intestinal muscles. \\nAvoiding constipation reduces the risk of many other diseases. Soluble fibre helps in lowering blood cholesterol and sugar levels. Insoluble fibre speeds up the movement of carcinogens (cancer causing agents) from intestine.\\n  \\nFibre supplements (such as Ispaghol husk) should be used only with a physician’s recommendations. \\nTaken properly, these supplements may help in constipation and in lowering cholesterol levels.18\\n8. Nutrition eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.18.2.2 BALANCED DIET\\nHumans require various types of nutrients in order to keep them healthy and fit. These nutrients \\nshould be taken appropriately in diet. A balanced diet may be defined as the one which contains all the essential nutrients in correct proportion for the normal growth and development of body. A balanced diet is related to one’s age, gender and activity. It should include different types of nutrients and should be according to the energy requirements. The following chart shows some of the common foods, taken in Pakistan, and the percentage of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins in each of them.\\nCommon foods and the percentage of nutrients\\nFood Carbohydrates Lipids Proteins\\nBread (Roti) 52% 03% 09%\\nRice 23% 0.1% 2.2%\\nPotato 19% 0.1%  02%\\nApple 12.8%  0.5% 0.3%\\nEggs 0.7% 12%  13%\\nMilk 04% 04% 03%\\nButter 0.4% 81% 0.6%\\nChicken 0 11% 20%\\nRelation of balanced diet with age, gender and activity\\nDuring growth period of the body, there is higher metabolic rate in body cells and so body needs a balanced diet that contains more energy. Adults need less proteins per kilogram body weights, but a growing boy or girl needs more proteins per kilogram weight. Similarly, children need more calcium and iron for their growing bones and red blood cells respectively.\\n“Let thy food be thy medicine”:\\nHippocrates19\\n8. Nutrition eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Gender has an impact on the requirements of a balanced diet. Women have comparatively less \\nmetabolic rate than men of the same age and weight. So men need a balanced diet that provides comparatively more energy. Different people have different lifestyles and varied nature of work. A man with sedentary habits does not require as much energy as the man who is on his feet for most of the day.\\nTable 8.4: Estimated energy requirements (in Kilocalories) according to age, gender and \\nactivity\\nGenderAge(years)Activity Level\\nSedentaryModerately\\nactiveActive\\nChildMale/Female2-3 1,000 1,000-1,400 1,000-1,400\\nFemale4-8 1,200 1,400-1,600 1,400-1,800\\n9-13 1,600 1,600-2,000 1,800-2,200\\n14-18 1,800 2,000 2,400\\n19-30 2,000 2,000-2,200 2,400\\n31-50 1,800 2,000 2,200\\n50+ 1,600 1,800 2,000-2,200\\nMale4-8 1,400 1,400-1,600 1,600-2,000\\n9-13 1,800 1,800-2,200 2,000-2,600\\n14-18 2,200 2,400-2,800 2,800-3,200\\n19-30 2,400 2,600-2,800 3,000\\n31-50 2,200 2,400-2,600 2,800-3,000\\n50+ 2,000 2,200-2,400 2,400-2,80020\\n8.

It often refers to undernutrition resulting from inadequate consumption, poor absorption, or excessive loss of nutrients. Malnutrition also includes over-nutrition, resulting from overeating or excessive intake of specific nutrients. \\nMost commonly, malnourished people either do not have enough calories in their diet, or eat a diet \\nthat lacks protein, vitamins, or trace minerals. Malnutrition weakens the immune system, impairs physical and mental health, slows thinking, stunts growth and affects fetal development. \\nCommon forms of malnutrition include protein-energy malnutrition (PEM), mineral deficiency \\ndisease (MDD), and over-intake of nutrients (OIN).\\nA physician advises us; “ you should start taking whole wheat bread instead of enriched white bread.” The purpose of this advice is that we should take more---------(component of food)Dietary fibre21\\n8. Nutrition eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1According to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), malnutrition contributes to the \\ndeaths of more than 6 million children (under age five) each year.\\na- Protein-Energy Malnutrition\\nProtein-energy malnutrition means inadequate availability or absorption of energy and proteins in \\nthe body. It is the leading cause of death in children in developing countries. It may lead to diseases such as Kwashiorkor and marasmus.\\n1. Kwashiorkor  is due to protein deficiency at the age of about 12 months when breast feeding is \\ndiscontinued. It can also develop at any time during a child’s growing years. Children may grow to \\nnormal height but are abnormally thin.\\n2. Marasmus usually develops between the ages of six months and one year. Patients lose all their \\nbody fat and muscle strength, and acquire a skeletal appearance. Children with marasmus show poor growth and look small for their age\\nb- Mineral Deficiency Diseases\\nDiseases resulting from the deficiency of a mineral are relatively rare among humans. Some examples are given below;\\n1. Goiter is a condition caused by an insufficient amount of iodine in diet. Iodine is used by thyroid \\ngland to produce hormones that control the body’s normal functioning and growth. If sufficient iodine is not available in a person’s diet, thyroid gland becomes enlarged and it results in swelling in neck. This condition is known as goitre.22\\n8. Nutrition eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1\\nFigure 8.2: Children suffering from (a) Kawshiorkar, (b) Marasmus\\n2. Anemia is the most common of all mineral deficiency diseases. The term anemia literally means \\n“a lack of blood.” It is caused when the number of red blood cells is reduced than the normal. Haemoglobin molecule contains a single atom of iron at its centre. If body fails to receive sufficient amounts of iron, adequate number of haemoglobin molecules are not formed. In this case, there are not enough functioning of red blood cells. The patient is weak and there is shortage of oxygen supply to body’s cells. 23\\n8. Nutrition eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1c- Over-Intake of Nutrients\\nOver-intake of nutrients (OIN) is a form of malnutrition in which more nutrients are taken than the \\namount required for normal growth, development and metabolism. The effects of over-intake of nutrients are usually intensified when there is reduction in daily physical activity (decline in energy expenditure).\\nOver-intake of nutrients causes a number of health problems. For example high intake of \\ncarbohydrates and fats leads to obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular problems. Similarly, high dose of vitamin A causes loss of appetite and liver problems. Excess intake of vitamin D can lead to deposition of calcium in various tissues.\\nEFFECTS OF MALNUTRITION\\nAn extended period of malnutrition can lead to problems like starvation, heart diseases, constipation and obesity.\\nStarvation is a severe reduction in nutrient and energy intake and is the most horrible effect of \\nmalnutrition. In humans, prolonged starvation causes permanent organ damage and eventually \\nresults in death.\\nHeart diseases are also increasing on the global level. One of the causes of heart diseases is \\nmalnutrition. People who take unbalanced diet (high in fats) are more exposed to heart problems.\\nConstipation:  Malnutrition often leads to situations where people cannot schedule their meals. \\nThis irregularity results in many health problems including constipation.Obesity means becoming over-weight and it may also be due to malnutrition. People who take \\nfood that contains energy more than their requirement and do very little physical work can become \\nobese. Obesity is known as the mother-disease and may lead to heart problems, hypertension, diabetes etc\\nAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, more than 25,000 \\npeople die of starvation every day. On average, every five seconds a child dies from starvation.24\\n8. Nutrition eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1The World Health Organization (WHO)estimates that, within the next few years, diseases due to \\nmalnutrition will become the principal global causes of mortality.\\nFAMINE - THE MAJOR CAUSE OF MALNUTRITION\\nFamine means the lack of enough food to feed all people living in an area. The most terrible famines of the twentieth century are the Ethiopian famine (1983-85) and the North Korean famine (1990s). The major causes of famine are unequal distribution of food, drought, flooding or increasing population.\\nUnequal distribution of food\\nThe achievements in science have enabled human beings to produce better food in terms of quality and quantity. Today the agricultural practices produce more than enough food that can be supplied to every one on the Earth. But due to political and administrative problems, food is not equally distributed to different regions of the world. The result is that there is always surplus food in countries like America, UK, and Canada etc. and at the same time people have nothing to eat in countries like Ethiopia, Somalia etc.\\nFamines may also be due to the problems created by humans e.g. wars and wrong economic \\npolicies\\nThe World Food Program (WFP) is the food aid branch of the United Nations. It is the world’s \\nlargest agency providing food to more than 90 million people in 80 countries.   \\nDroughtA drought is a period of time when there is not enough water to support agricultural and human needs. Drought is usually due to a long period of below-normal rainfall. Droughts decrease or even stop the crop yields and it results in famine.\\nAnalyzing and Interpreting\\nIn the comparative chart of daily diet and balanced diet requirements, mention the visible \\nsymptoms caused by nutrient deficiencies.25\\n8. Nutrition eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Flooding\\nIt occurs due to more than normal rainfall or due to weak water distribution system. Rivers and \\ncanals overflow their banks and destroy the soil quality of agricultural lands. It becomes impossible to grow crops immediately after flooding. In this way, flooding may be a reason for short-term famine.\\nIncreasing population\\nIn spite of the global increase in food production, millions of human beings are undernourished. In the over-populated regions of world, large populations overuse natural resources to grow maximum food in order to meet the problems of food shortage. It leads to dry and infertile lands and depletion of resources. In such situations crops can no longer be grown and famines result.\\n8.3 DIGESTION IN HUMAN\\nOur cells require oxygen, water, salts, amino acids, simple sugars, fatty acids, and vitamins. These can cross cell membranes to enter cells. Amino acids, simple sugars and fatty acids are rare in our environment. Such substances are usually parts of larger molecules like proteins, polysaccharides and lipids, which cannot cross the membranes. There is a need of converting such large and non-diffusible molecules into smaller and diffusible molecules (that can cross the membranes). This is achieved through the process of digestion.\\nAfter digestion, the diffusible molecules from the digestive system reach body cells through blood. \\nHere, they are assimilated (to get energy and to synthesize our own structures). At the same time, the indigestible part of food is eliminated out of body through the process of defecation. In simple words, the nutrition in humans comprises of the following phases.\\n1- Ingestion The process of taking in food.\\n2- Digestion The process of breaking up complex substances into simpler substances.\\n3- Absorption Diffusion of digested food into blood and lymph.\\n4- AssimilationConversion or incorporation of absorbed simple food into the complex \\nsubstances constituting the body.\\n5- Defecation Elimination of undigested food from the body.26\\n8. Nutrition eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1We eat mutton and digest its proteins into amino acids. These amino acids are used to synthesize our proteins.\\n8.3.1 HUMAN ALIMENTARY CANAL\\nThe digestive system of human consists of a long tube that extends from mouth to anus.This tube \\nis called alimentary canal. Its main sections are oral cavity, pharynx,oesophagus, stomach, small intestines and large intestine. In addition, there are many glands associated with alimentary canal. These are in the form of three pairs of salivary glands, a pancreas and a liver.\\nWe will go through the structure and functioning of digestive system by assuming how a bite of \\nbread ‘roti’ taken with some dish (like mutton) is digested and how small molecules like amino acids, simple sugars, fatty acids, vitamins, salts and water are provided to cells.\\nOral cavity - Selection, grinding, partial digestion\\nOral cavity is the space behind mouth and has many important functions in the whole process of digestion. Food selection  is one of them. When food enters oral cavity, it is tasted and felt. If the \\ntaste of mutton suggests that it is old, we reject it. If teeth or tongue detect some hard object, such as dirt, we also reject that bite. The senses of smell and vision also help oral cavity in the selection of food.\\nThe second function of oral cavity is the grinding of food by teeth. It is known as chewing or \\nmastication . This is useful because oesophagus can pass only small pieces. Enzymes also cannot \\nact on large pieces of food. They require small pieces with large surface areas to attack.\\nThe third and fourth function of oral cavity are lubrication and chemical digestion of food. The \\nchewing process stimulates the three pairs of salivary glands (under tongue, behind jaws, and in \\nfront of ears) to release a juice called saliva in oral cavity. Saliva adds water and mucous to food \\nwhich act as lubricant to ease the passage of food through oesophagus. Saliva also contains an enzyme salivary amylase, which helps in the semi-digestion of starch.\\nDuring the processes of chewing, lubrication and semi-digestion, the pieces of food are rolled up by the tongue into small, slippery, spherical mass called bolus. We swallow bolus and push it in \\noesophagus through pharynx.27\\n8. Nutrition eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Pharynx and Oesophagus - Swallowing and Peristalsis\\nDuring swallowing, bolus is pushed to the back of mouth by tongue. When tongue pushes bolus, the \\nsoft palate also moves upward and to rear. In this way, the opening of nasal cavity is closed. When swallowed, the bolus passes pharynx to enter oesophagus. Pharynx has adaptations to prevent the entry of bolus particles in trachea (wind pipe to lungs).\\nDuring swallowing, larynx (the top of trachea) moves upward and forces the epiglottis (a flap of \\ncartilage) into horizontal position. Thus glottis i.e. the opening of trachea is closed. The beginning of swallowing action is voluntary, but once food reaches the back of mouth, swallowing becomes automatic.\\nFigure 8.4: Steps in swallowing\\nIn adult human, oesophagus is about 25 cm long.28\\n8. Nutrition eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1After being swallowed, food enters the tube called oesophagus, which connects pharynx to stomach. \\nNeither pharynx nor oesophagus contributes to digestion and the previous digestive actions of saliva continue. \\nPeristalsis moves food from oral cavity to rectum. Peristalsis  is defined as the waves of contraction \\nand relaxation in the smooth muscles of alimentary canal walls.\\nFigure 8.4: Steps in swallowing\\nIf due to any reason, the direction of  peristalsis \\nreverses,what would be the result?Vomiting\\nFigure 8.5: Peristalsis29\\n8.

Nutrition eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Stomach - Digestion, churning and melting\\nStomach is a dilated part of alimentary canal. It is J-shaped, located in the left of abdomen, just \\nbeneath diaphragm. Stomach has two main portions. Cardiac portion of stomach is present immediately after oesophagus and pyloric portion  is located beneath cardiac portion. Stomach has \\ntwo sphincters (openings which are guarded by muscles). Cardiac sphincter  is between stomach \\nand oesophagus while pyloric sphincter  is between stomach and small intestine. Bolus enters \\nstomach from oesophagus through cardiac sphincter.\\nWhen food enters stomach, the gastric glands found in the stomach wall are stimulated to secrete \\ngastric juice. Gastric juice is composed chiefly of mucous, hydrochloric acid, and a protein-digesting \\nenzyme pepsinogen. Hydrochloric acid converts the inactive enzyme pepsinogen into its active \\nform i.e. pepsin. HCl also kills microorganisms present in food. Pepsin partially digests the protein portion of food (bulk of mutton) into polypeptides and shorter peptide chains.\\nFigure 8.6: Structure of stomach31\\n8. Nutrition eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Animation 8.7: Stomach - Digestion\\nSource & Credit: gifsoup32\\n8. Nutrition eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1An interesting problem is raised here. Pepsin is a powerful protein-digesting enzyme. Why does \\nnot it digest the stomach walls, which are mostly proteins? We saw that pepsin is not released in its active form. Rather it is secreted as inactive pepsinogen, which requires HCl for activation. The mucous of gastric juice forms a thick coating over the inner walls of stomach and neutralizes the HCl there. It makes pepsinogen difficult to be activated and to attack stomach walls.\\nIn stomach, food is further broken apart through a process of churning . The walls of stomach \\ncontract and relax and these movements help in thorough mixing of gastric juice and food. The \\nchurning action also produces heat which helps to melt the lipid content of food.\\nThe starch in our bite of bread and the protein in mutton have been partially digested and the food \\nhas been converted to a soup-like mixture called chyme. After it, the pyloric sphincter allows a little \\nmass of chyme to enter duodenum. \\nSome quantity of gastric juice is always present in stomach. When bite is in oral cavity, brain sends messages to stomach walls to secrete some gastric juice. When food reaches stomach, more gastric juice is secreted according to needs. If there is little or no protein in food, stomach does not secrete more gastric juice. On the other hand, if more proteins are present in food, abundant gastric juice is secreted. In this case, already present gastric juice begins the digestion of huge proteins into peptides. These peptides stimulate some cells of stomach walls to release a hormone called gastrin.  This hormone enters blood and is distributed to all parts of body. In stomach, it has \\nspecific effect and stimulates the gastric glands to secrete more gastric juice.\\nSmall Intestine - Complete digestion and absorption\\nDuodenum  comprises of the first 10 inches (25 cm) of small intestine and it is the part of alimentary \\ncanal where most of the digestive process occurs. Here, food is further mixed with 3 different secretions:Bile also contains pigments that are the by-products of red blood cell destruction in liver; these \\nbile pigments are eliminated from body with faeces.33\\n8. Nutrition eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.11. Bile  from liver helps in the digestion of lipids through emulsification i.e. by keeping the lipid \\ndroplets separate from one another.\\n2.\\n Pancreatic juice  \\nfrom pancreas contains enzymes trypsin, pancreatic amylase and lipase \\nwhich digest proteins, carbohydrates and lipids respectively.\\n3.\\n Intestinal juice\\n from intestine walls contains many enzymes for the complete digestion of all \\nkinds of food.\\nNext to the duodenum is 2.4 meters long jejunum. It is concerned with the rest of the digestion of \\nproteins, carbohydrates and lipids of our bite.\\nLast 3.5 meters long part of small intestine is ileum. It is concerned with the absorption of digested \\nfood. There are circular folds in the inner wall of ileum. These folds have numerous finger-like projections called villi (singular: villus). Villi increase the surface area of the inner walls and it helps \\na lot in the absorption of digested food. \\nEach villus is richly supplied with blood capillaries  and a vessel of lymphatic system, called lacteal.\\nThe walls of villus are only single-cell thick. The digested molecules i.e. simple sugars and amino \\nacids are absorbed from intestine into the blood capillaries present in villi.Blood carries them away from small intestine via the hepatic portal vein and goes to liver for filtering. Here, toxins are removed and extra food is stored. From liver, the required food molecules go towards heart via the hepatic vein. Fatty acids and glycerol, present in small intestine, are absorbed into the lacteal of villus. Lacteal carries them to the main lymphatic duct, from where they enter in bloodstream.\\nA non-functional finger-like process called appendix arises from the blind end of caecum. \\nInflammation of appendix due to infection causes severe pain. The infected appendix must be \\nremoved surgically otherwise it may burst and inflammation may spread in abdomen.\\nLarge intestine - Absorption of water and defecation\\nAfter the digested products of our bite have been absorbed in blood, the remaining mass enters large intestine. It has 3 parts; caecum (or pouch that forms the T-junction with small intestine), colon and rectum. From colon, water is absorbed into blood.As water is absorbed, the solid remains of food are called faeces. \\nFaeces mainly consists of the undigested material. Large number of bacteria,sloughed off cells of alimentary canal, bile pigments and water are also part of faeces.34\\n8. Nutrition eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Faeces are temporarily stored in rectum, which opens out through anus. Under normal conditions \\nwhen the rectum is filled up with faeces, it gives rise to a reflex and anus is opened for defecation. This reflex is consciously inhibited in adults but in infants it is controlled involuntarily. During growth, child learns to bring this reflex under voluntary control.\\nFigure 8.7: Folds and villi in small intestine\\nFunctions of large intestine include the elimination of faeces and ...............Absorption of water and salts35\\n8. Nutrition eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.18.3.2 ROLE OF LIVER\\nLiver is the largest gland of body. It is multi-lobed and dark reddish in appearance. It lies beneath \\nthe diaphragm on the right side of abdomen. In an adult human, it weighs about 1.5 kg and is the size of a football. A pear-shaped greenish yellow sac i.e. gallbladder lies along the right lobe of liver on ventral side.\\nFigure 8.8: Liver and associated organs\\nMany bacteria live in colon.They produce vitamin K, which is \\nnecessary for the coagulation of blood.36\\n8.

Nutrition eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Liver secretes bile, which is stored in gallbladder. When gallbladder contracts, bile is released \\ninto duodenum through common bile duct. Bile has no enzymes but contains bile salts for the \\nemulsification of lipids. It helps the lipid-digesting enzymes to attack on lipids. Besides digestion, \\nliver carries out a number of other functions, some of which are summarized here;\\n•\\n Removes amino groups from amino acids (de-amination).\\n•\\n Converts ammonia to a less toxic form i.e urea.\\n \\n•\\n Destroys the old red blood cells.\\n•\\n Manufactures blood clotting proteins called  fibrinogen.\\n•\\n Converts glucose into glycogen and, when required, breaks glycogen into glucose.\\n•\\n Converts carbohydrates and proteins into lipids and produces cholesterol.\\n•\\n Produces heat to maintain body temperature.\\n•\\n Stores fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) and mineral ions, such as iron.\\nThere is a growing concern about the harmful effects of carbonated soft drinks. They are very \\nacidic and make our bodies poor in oxygen. They contain phosphoric acid which dissolves \\ncalcium out of the bones. This results in bones weakening. The caffeine present in colas \\nincreases the heart rate and raises blood pressure.\\nAnalyzing and Interpreting:\\nIdentify the villus, epithelium, capillary network \\nand lacteal while examining the transverse \\nsections of small intestine (like the one given on \\nright).\\nIn which part of the alimentary canal,the maximum \\nabsorption of nutrients occurs?small intestine38\\n8.

This condition may be accompanied by abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. It occurs when required water is not absorbed in blood from colon.\\nThe main causes of diarrhoea include lack of adequate safe water. Diarrhoea is also caused by \\nviral or bacterial infections of large intestine. If sufficient food and water is available, the patient of diarrhoea recovers in a few days.\\nHowever, for malnourished individuals diarrhoea can lead to severe dehydration and can become \\nlife-threatening. The treatment for diarrhoea involves consuming adequate amounts of water (to replace the loss), preferably mixed with essential salts and some amount of nutrients. Antibiotics may be required if diarrhoea is due to bacterial infection. Preventions of diarrhoea include taking clean water and essential salts, eating regularly and taking hygienic measures.\\nWrite in correct sequence the parts of the alimentary canal where digestion of proteins,lipids and carbohydrates begins.Stomach,small intestine,oral cavity39\\n8.

The \\nmain causes of constipation include excessive absorption of water through colon, insufficient intake of dietary fibre, dehydration, use of medicines (e.g. those containing iron, calcium, and aluminium) and tumours in rectum or anus. Treatment of constipation is with a change in dietary and exercise habits. The medicines called laxatives (e.g. paraffin) are used for treatment. Constipation is usually easier to prevent than to treat. One should take the required quantities of water and dietary fibres.\\nULCER\\nUlcer (peptic ulcer) is a sore in the inner wall of gut (in oesophagus, duodenum or stomach). In ulcer, the acidic gastric juice gradually breaks down the tissue of the inner wall. Ulcer of stomach is called gastric ulcer. The causes of ulcer include excess acid, infection, long term use of anti-inflammatory medicines (including aspirin), smoking, drinking coffee, colas, and eating spicy foods.\\nThe signs and symptoms of ulcer include abdominal burning after meals or at midnight. Severe \\nulcers may cause abdominal pain, rush of saliva after an episode of regurgitation, nausea, loss of appetite and weight loss. Ulcer is treated with medicines, which neutralize the acidic affects of gastric juice. Spicy, acidic foods and smoking should be avoided as preventive measures.\\nUNDERSTANDING THE CONCEPTS\\n1.\\n  What are the effects of the lack of nitrate and magnesium ions on plant growth?\\n2.\\n  How are inorganic and organic fertilizers important in agriculture?\\n3.\\n  \\n Draw a table that can show sources, energy values and functions of carbohydrates, proteins       \\nand fats.\\n4.\\n How are vitamins A, C and D important in our diets?\\n5.\\n Which foods contain calcium and iron and what role these minerals play in our bodies?\\n6.\\n Why are water and dietary fibres considered important in our diets?\\n7.\\n Define balanced diet.

Transport eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1We know that life of organisms is the product of complex metabolic processes occurring in them. \\nIn order to run their metabolism, cells need some materials from environment and also need to dispose some materials into environment. For this purpose, materials are transported to and from cells. \\nOne method for the movement of molecules is diffusion but it alone cannot fulfill the needs. It takes \\nmuch time for materials in solution to diffuse even a few inches. For the molecules of materials, diffusion can work only in unicellular and simple multicellular organisms, because every corner of their body is in close and direct contact with environment. In complex multicellular bodies, cells are far apart from environment and such bodies need a comprehensive system for the transport of materials.\\n9.1 TRANSPORT IN PLANTS \\nWater is vital to plant life. It is necessary not just for photosynthesis and turgor, but much of the cellular activities occur in the presence of water molecules. Internal temperature of plant body is also regulated by water. Land plants get water and minerals from soil. After absorption by roots, water and minerals have to be transported to the aerial parts of body. Similarly food is manufactured in leaves (by photosynthesis). This food is transported to other parts of body for utilization and storage.\\nRecalling:\\nCells are the primary sites for metabolic processes. That is why they are regarded as the units of life.3\\n9. Transport eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Animation 9.2: Transport in plant\\nSource & Credit: ontrack-media4\\n9. Transport eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1All land plants (except mosses and liverworts), have developed complex vascular tissues (xylem \\nand phloem) that move water and food throughout plant body.\\nRecalling\\nXylem tissue is responsible for the transport of water and dissolved substances from roots to \\naerial parts. It consists of vessel elements and tracheids. Phloem tissue is responsible for the \\nconduction of dissolved organic matter (food) between different parts of plant body. It consists \\nof sieve tube cells and companion cells.\\nWater always moves from an area of higher water potential to an area of lower water potential. \\nThe relationship between the concentration of solute and water potential is inverse. When there \\nis a lot of solute ( i.e. hypertonic solution), the water potential is low and vice versa.\\n9.1.1 WATER AND ION UPTAKE \\nIn addition to anchor the plant, roots perform two other vital functions. First; they absorb water and salts from soil. Second; they provide conducting tissues for distributing these substances to the tissues of stem. \\nThe conducting tissues (xylem and phloem) of root are grouped in the centre to form a rod-\\nshaped core. This rod extends throughout the length of root. Outside the conducting tissues, there \\nis a narrow layer of thin-walled cells, the pericycle.\\nA single layer of cells i.e. endodermis surrounds this pericycle. External to this, there is a broad zone \\nof cortex. It consists of large and thin-walled cells.Cortex is bounded on outside by a single layer \\nof epidermal cells. Roots also have clusters of tiny root hairs , which are actually the extensions \\nof epidermal cells.Root  hairs provide large surface area for absorption. They grow out into the spaces between soil particles where they are in direct contact with water. The cytoplasm of root hairs has higher concentration of salts than soil water, so water moves by osmosis into root hairs. Salts also enter5\\n9. Transport eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Plants also form beneficial \\nrelationships with soil bacteria and fungi in order to increase absorption of minerals. \\nroot hairs by diffusion or active transport. After their entry into root hairs, water and salts travel through intercellular spaces or through cells (via channels, called plasmodesmata) and reach xylem tissue. Once in xylem, water and salts are carried to all the aerial parts of plant.\\nFigure 9.1: Uptake of water and ions by root\\n6\\n9. Transport eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.19.1.2 TRANSPIRATION \\nTranspiration is the loss of water from plant surface through evaporation. This loss may occur \\nthrough stomata in leaves, through the cuticle present on leaf epidermis, and through special openings called lenticels  present in the stems of some plants.\\nMost of the transpiration occurs through stomata and is called stomatal transpiration . The \\nmesophyll cells of leaf provide large surface area for the evaporation of water. Water is drawn from xylem into mesophyll cells, from where it comes out and makes a water-film on the cell walls of mesophyll. From here, water evaporates into the air spaces of the leaf. Water vapours then diffuse from air spaces towards stomata and then pass to outside air (Figure 9.2).\\nAnimation 9.3: Transportation \\nSource & Credit: atmos.uiuc7\\n9.

Transport eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Figure 9.2: Events of transpiration shown in the section of a leaf\\nOpening and closing of \\nstomata \\nMost plants keep their \\nstomata open during the day and close them at night. It is the responsibility of stomata to regulate transpiration via the actions of guard cells. The two guard cells of a stoma are attached to each other at their ends. The inner concave sides of guard cells that enclose a stoma are thicker than the outer convex sides. When guard cells get water and become turgid, their shapes are like two beans and the stoma between them opens. When guard cells loose water and become flaccid, their inner sides touch each other and stoma closes.\\nIn chapter 4 we have studied that the concentration of solutes (glucose) in guard cells is responsible for the opening and closing of stomata. Recent studies have revealed that light causes the movement of potassium ions from epidermal cells into guard cells. Water follows these ions and enters guard cells. Thus their turgidity increases and stoma opens. As the day progresses, guard cells make glucose i.e. become hypertonic. So water stays in them. At the end of the day, potassium ions flow back from guard cells to epidermal cells and the concentration of glucose also falls. Due to it, water moves to epidermal cells and guard cells loose turgor. It causes the closure of stoma.\\nSome plants open their stomata during night when overall water stress is low.9\\n9.

Transport eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1\\nFigure 9.3: Opening and closing of stoma\\nF ACTORS AFFECTING THE RATE OF TRANSPIRATION\\nThe rate of transpiration is directly controlled by the opening and closing of stomata and it is under \\nthe influence of light. In strong light, the rate of transpiration is very high as compared to dim light or no light. Other factors which affect the rate of transpiration are given below.\\nTemperature\\nHigher temperature reduces the humidity of surrounding air and also increases the kinetic energy of water molecules. In this way it increases the rate of transpiration. The rate of transpiration doubles with every rise of 10 \\noC in temperature. But, very high temperatures i.e. 40-45 oC cause \\nclosure of stomata, so transpiration stops and plant does not loose the much needed water.\\nAir humidity\\nWhen air is dry, water vapours diffuse more quickly from the surface of mesophyll cells into leaf air spaces and then from air spaces to outside. This increases the rate of transpiration. In humid air, the rate of the diffusion of water vapours is reduced and the rate of transpiration is low.11\\n9. Transport eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Practical Work:\\nTo describe the structure and number of stomata present on the epidermal peel of a leaf \\nStomata are the microscopic pores in the epidermis of leaves. They are the passageways for gases and water vapours.Problem: Observe the stomata on the epidermal peel of a leaf and describe their structure and number.Apparatus required: Petri dish, water, glass slides and cover slips, methylene blue, light microscopeAir movement\\nWind (air in motion) carries away the evaporated water from leaves and it causes an increase in the rate of evaporation from the surfaces of mesophyll. When air is still, the rate of transpiration is reduced.\\nLeaf surface area\\nThe rate of transpiration also depends upon the surface area of leaf. More surface area provides more stomata and there is more transpiration .\\nSIGNIFICANCE OF TRANSPIRATION\\nTranspiration is called a necessary evil. It means that transpiration is a potentially harmful process but is unavoidable too. Transpiration may be a harmful process in the sense that during the conditions of drought, loss of water from plant results in serious desiccation, wilting and often death. On the other hand, transpiration is necessary too. It creates a pulling force called transpirational \\npull which is principally responsible for the conduction of water and salts from roots to the aerial \\nparts of plant body. When water transpires from the surfaces of plant, it leaves a cooling effect on plant. This is especially important in warmer environments. Moreover, the wet surfaces of leaf cells allow gaseous exchange.There is strong evidence that even mild water stress results in reduced growth rate in plants.12\\n9. Transport eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Background information:\\n•\\n A stoma is an opening through which leaves exchange gases and loose water (transpire).\\n•\\n Each stoma is surrounded by two bean-shaped guard cells.\\n•\\n The epidermis of leaves has stomata among its epidermal cells.\\nProcedure:1. Take a thick leaf and peel off a thin layer (epidermis) from its surface.2. Place the thin layer in water in a Petri dish.3. Cut a piece of the peeled off epidermis and place it in a drop of water on a glass slide.4. Pour a drop of methylene blue and place a cover slip on the material.5. Observe under the low and high powers of the microscope.Observation: Observe the epidermis and \\npoint out the stomata present in it. Count the total stomata and count \\nhow many of these are open.

What is the structure of guard cells and how does it help in the opening and closing of stomata?\\nAnalyzing and Interpreting:Wilting in a potted plant:Due to non-availability or extra loss of water, the cells of herbaceous plants loose their turgidity and wilt. Wilting is defined as the loss of rigidity of non-woody parts of plants. This phenomenon can be observed by keeping a herbaceous plant without watering for a few days.13\\n9.

Place the potted plant on a glass plate and invert a dry bell-jar over the pot and plant.3. Leave the apparatus in sunlight.4. Set up a control experiment with no plant.Observation: After an hour, drops of colourless liquid are seen inside the bell-jar with the plant. To show that these drops are water, touch them with anhydrous copper sulphate (white) and its colour changes to blue. No drops of water are found in the control experiment where there was no plant (Figure 9.6).Results:The water droplets on the inside of the jar containing the plant came from the leaves because the rest of the plant body and the soil were covered with polythene bag. Thus the potted plant present in the bell-jar showed the phenomenon of transpiration.\\nFigure 9.6: Experiment set up for transpiration in potted plantAnalyzing and Interpreting:\\nIdentification of xylem and phloem in the prepared slides.See the photomicrographs and identify the xylem and phloem tissues by observing the prepared slides available in the school laboratory.15\\n9.

(The glass slides will prevent the cobalt chloride papers to come in contact with atmospheric humidity.) Figure 9.8.\\nObservation: Note changes in the colour of the two cobalt chloride papers. Both papers will start turning pink. Note that the paper placed at the lower surface of the leaf takes less time in turning pink.Results:Cobalt chloride paper placed on the lower surface of leaf contacted more water as compared the paper placed on the upper surface. It means that there is more water loss (transpiration) from the lower surface of leaf. The reason is that leaves have more stomata on their lower surfaces.Evaluation:i. What does it show when blue cobalt chloride paper starts turning pink?ii. What is the relationship between the rate of transpiration and the number of stomata?\\nFigure 9.8: Experiment to explore the rate of transpiration on the two surfaces of a leaf18\\n9. Transport eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.19.1.3 TRANSPORT OF WATER \\nThe process by which water is raised to considerable heights in plants has been studied for years \\nin botany. The result of this research is “cohesion-tension theory” .\\nAccording to this theory, the force which carries water (and dissolved materials) upward through the xylem is transpirational pull. Transpiration creates a pressure difference that pulls water and salts up from roots.When a leaf transpires (loses water), the water concentration of its mesophyll cells drops. This drop causes water to move by osmosis from the xylem of leaf into mesophyll cells. When one water molecule moves up in the xylem of the leaf, it creates a pulling force that continues all the way to root. \\nThis pulling force created by the transpiration \\nof water is called transpirational pull. It also causes water to move transversely (from root epidermis to cortex and pericycle). Following are the reasons for the creation of transpirational pull.•\\n Water \\nis held in a tube (xylem) that has small \\ndiameter.\\n•\\n Water \\nmolecules adhere to the walls of xylem \\ntube (adhesion).\\n•\\n Water molecules cohere to each other (cohesion).\\nThese \\nattractions make an overall tension among water molecules. This tension forms ‘columns’ of \\nwater. The columns of water move from root to shoot and the water content of the soil enters in these ‘columns’.Animation 9.2 :  Translocation Of Water And Nutrients\\nSource & Credit: Plantcellbiology19\\n9.

Transport eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.19.1.4 TRANSPORT OF FOOD \\nPhloem is responsible for \\ntransporting food substance throughout plant body. The glucose formed during photosynthesis in mesophyll cells, is used in respiration and the excess of it is converted into sucrose. In most plants, food is transported in the form of sucrose. Like the concept of “water movement in plants”, movement of food in plants has been studied for years. The currently accepted hypothesis states that transport of food is through pressure-flow \\nmechanism . In pressure-flow  \\nmechanism, food is moved from sources to sinks.\\nFigure 9.10: Transport of food Sources include the exporting organs, typically a mature leaf or storage organ. Sinks are the areas of active metabolism or storage e.g. roots, tubers, developing fruits and leaves, and growing regions. A storage organ is capable of storing food and exporting the stored materials. 21\\n9. Transport eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1For example; root of beet is a sink in first growing season, but becomes source in next growing \\nseason, when sugars are utilized in the growth of new shoots. \\nAt source, food (sugars) is moved by active transport into the sieve tubes of phloem. Due to the \\npresence of sugar in sieve tubes, their solute concentration increases and water enters them from xylem (via osmosis). This results in higher pressure of water in these tubes, which drives the solution of food towards sink.\\nXylem is a one way street from roots to leaves for water and salts. Phloem is a two way street for \\nfood. The direction of the movement of food is decided by supply and demand in sources and \\nsinks.\\nPlants need a lot of water. Young Brassica plants take up an amount of water equal to their shoot \\nweight in about 5 hours - if that applied to us, we would have to drink 3 gallons of water an hour \\nto stay alive!At the sink end, food is unloaded by active transport. Water also exits from the sieve tubes. The exit of water decreases pressure in sieve tubes, which causes a mass flow from the higher pressure at the source to the now lowered pressure at the sink (Figure 9.10).22\\n9. Transport eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1\\nAccording to the pressure flow \\nmechanism what is the actual force behind the movement of food in phloem?     Drop in the pressure at the sink end.9.2 TRANSPORT IN HUMAN \\nLike other higher animals, the task of the transport of different material in human body is performed by two systems i.e. blood circulatory system and lymphatic system. The two systems are well-coordinated and associated with each other. Here we will go into the details of human blood circulatory system (or cardiovascular system). Like other vertebrates, humans have a closed blood circulatory system (meaning that blood never leaves the network of arteries, veins and capillaries).The main components of the human blood circulatory system are blood, heart and blood vessels.\\nRecalling\\nSome invertebrates like arthropods have open circulatory system\\nHow is plasma separated from blood?\\nBlood is taken from an artery and an anticoagulant (chemical that inhibits blood clotting) is \\nmixed in it. After about 5 minutes, plasma separates from blood cells, which settle down.23\\n9. Transport eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.19.2.1 BLOOD \\nBlood is a specialized body fluid (a connective tissue) that is composed of a liquid called blood \\nplasma and blood cells. The weight of blood in our body is about 1/12th of our body. The average adult body has about 5 litres of blood.In a healthy person, plasma constitutes about 55% by volume of blood, and cells or cell-like bodies are about 45% by volume of the blood (Figure 9.11).\\nFigure 9.11: Percentage composition of human blood\\nBLOOD PLASMA\\nPlasma is primarily water in which proteins, salts, metabolites and wastes are dissolved.Water constitutes about 90-92% of plasma and 8-10% are dissolved substances. 24\\n9. Transport eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Salts make up 0.9 % of plasma, by weight. Sodium chloride (the table salt) and salts of bicarbonate \\nare present in considerable amounts. Ca, Mg, Cu, K and Zn are found in trace amounts. Changes in the concentration of any salt can change the pH of blood (normal is 7.4). Proteins make 7-9 % \\nby weight of plasma. The important proteins present in plasma are antibodies, fibrinogen (blood clotting protein), albumin (maintains the water balance of blood) etc. Plasma also contains the digested food (absorbed from digestive system), nitrogenous wastes and hormones. Respiratory gases i.e. CO\\n2 and O2 are present in the plasma.\\nBLOOD CELLS AND CELL-LIKE BODIES\\nThese include red blood cells (erythrocytes), white blood cells (leukocytes) and platelets (thrombocytes).\\nFigure 9.12: Different cells and cell-like bodies in blood plasma\\nRed Blood Cells (Erythrocytes)\\nThese are the most numerous of blood cells. A cubic millimeter of blood contains 5 to 5.5 million of RBCs in males, and 4 to 4.5 million in females. When RBCs are formed, they have nucleus. In mammals, when a red blood cell matures, its nucleus is lost. 25\\n9. Transport eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Animation 9.7: Blood Cells\\nSource & Credit: imgur26\\n9. Transport eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1After the loss of nucleus, RBC enters blood. About 95% of the cytoplasm of RBCs is filled with \\nhemoglobin, which transports O2 and small amounts of CO2 .The remaining 5% consists of enzymes, \\nsalts and other proteins. RBCs are biconcave and have an elastic cell membrane. In the embryonic and foetal life, they are formed in liver and spleen. In adults, they are formed in the red bone marrow of short and flat bones, such as sternum, ribs and vertebrae. Average life span of RBC is about four months (120 days) after which it breaks down in liver and spleen by phagocytosis.\\nWhite Blood Cells (Leukocytes)\\nThese are colourless, because they do not contain pigments. They are not confined to blood vessels and also migrate out into tissue fluid. One cubic millimeter of blood contains 7000 to 8000 WBCs. Their life span ranges from months to even years, depending on body’s needs. WBCs function as the main agents in body’s defence system. There are two main types of WBCs.\\nGranulocytes  have granular cytoplasm. These include neutrophils  (destroy small particles by \\nphagocytosis), eosinophils  (break inflammatory substances and kill parasites) and basophils \\n(prevent blood clotting).Agranulocytes  have clear cytoplasm and include monocytes (produce macrophages which engulf \\ngerms) and B and T lymphocytes  (produce antibodies and kill germs).In a normal person about 2-10 million red blood cells are formed and destroyed every second.\\nPlatelets (Thrombocytes)\\nThey are not cells, but are fragments of large cells of bone marrow, called megakaryocytes. They \\ndo not have any nucleus and any pigment. One cubic millimeter of blood contains 250,000 platelets. \\nThe average life span of a blood platelet is about 7 to 8 days. Platelets help in blood clotting. The clot serves as a temporary seal at the damaged area.27\\n9. Transport eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1WBCs die in the process of killing the germs. \\nThese dead cells accumulate and make the white substance called pus, seen at infection sites.In dengue fever, there is a sharp decrease in the number of platelets in blood.

Transport eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Leukaemia (blood cancer)\\nLeukaemia is the production of great number of immature and abnormal white blood cells. This \\nis caused by a cancerous mutation (change in gene) in bone marrow or lymph tissue cells. The mutation results in uncontrolled production of defective white blood cells (leukocytes).It is a very serious disorder and patient needs to change blood regularly with normal blood, got from donors. It can be cured by bone marrow transplant. It is effective in most cases , but very expensive treatment.The world celebrates the International Thalassaemia Day on 8th of May. This day is dedicated \\nto raise public awareness about thalassaemia and to highlight the importance of the care for \\nthalassaemia patients.\\nThalassaemia (g. thalassa = sea; haem = blood)\\nIt is also called Cooley's anaemia on the name of Thomas B. Cooley, an American physician. It is a genetic problem due to mutations in the gene of haemoglobin. The mutation results in the production of defective haemoglobin and the patient cannot transport oxygen properly. The blood of these patients is to be replaced regularly, with normal blood. It can be cured by bone marrow transplant but it does not give 100% cure rate.\\nBLOOD GROUP SYSTEMS\\nBlood group systems are a classification of blood based on the presence or absence of antigens on the surface of red blood cells. An antigen is a molecule that can stimulate an immune response (antibody production etc.).ABO Blood Group System  \\nIt is the most important blood group system in humans. It was discovered by the Austrian scientist Karl Landsteiner, who found four different blood groups (blood types) in 1900. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for his work. \\nIn this system, there are four different blood groups which are distinct from each other on the basis \\nof specific antigens (antigen A and B) present on the surface of RBCs. A person having antigen A has blood group A, a person having antigen B has blood group B, a person having both antigens has blood group AB, and a person having none of the A and B antigens has blood group O.There are about 60-80 million people in the world who carry thalassaemia. India, Pakistan and Iran are \\nseeing a large increase of thalassaemia patients. Pakistan alone has 250,000 such patients. The patients \\nrequire blood transfusions for lifetime. (Source: The Thalassaemia International Foundation)30\\n9. Transport eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1After birth, two types of antibodies i.e. anti-A & anti-B antibodies appear in the blood serum of \\nindividuals. These antibodies are present according to the absence of corresponding antigen. In persons with blood group A, antigen A is present and antigen B is absent. So their blood will contain anti-B antibodies. In persons with blood group B,antigen B is present and antigen A is absent. So their blood will contain anti-A antibody.\\nA total of 29 human blood group systems are now recognized by the International Society of Blood \\nTransfusion (ISBT).\\nIn persons with blood group AB, antigens A & B are present i.e. neither is absent. So their blood serum will contain no antibody. In persons with blood group O, neither antigen A nor antigen B is present i.e. both are absent. So their blood serum will contain both antibodies i.e. anti-A & anti-B.\\nFigure 9.14: Presence and absence of antigens and antibodies in ABO blood group system31\\n9. Transport eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Blood transfusions in ABO blood group system\\nBlood transfusion is the process of transferring blood or blood-based products from one person \\ninto the circulatory system of another. Blood transfusions can be life-saving in some situations, such as massive blood loss due to injury, or can be used to replace blood lost during surgery. People suffering from anaemia, haemophilia, thalassaemia or sickle-cell disease may require frequent blood transfusions. \\nA number of infectious diseases (such as AIDS, hepatitis B and hepatitis C etc.) can pass from the \\naffected blood donor to recipient. Before blood transfusion, the blood of donor is checked for \\nthe presence of germs etc.\\nTransfusion of blood is done after confirming that no agglutination  (clumping of cells ) results in \\nthe blood of recipient. If agglutination occurs, the clumped cells can not pass through capillaries. For the confirmation of no agglutination, blood samples of donor and recipient are cross-matched for compatibility. Antibodies of recipient’s blood may destroy the corresponding antigen-containing RBCs of donor or antibodies of donor’s blood may destroy antigen-containing RBCs of recipient.\\nO blood group individuals are called universal donors, because they can donate blood to the \\nrecipients of every other blood group. AB blood group individuals are called universal recipients, \\nbecause they can receive transfusions from the donors of every other blood group.\\nRh Blood Group System (+ ve & - ve blood group system)\\nIn 1930’s, Karl Landsteiner discovered the Rh-blood group system. In this system, there are two blood groups i.e. Rh-positive and Rh-negative. These blood groups are distinct from each other on the basis of antigens called Rh factors  (first discovered in Rhesus monkey), present on the surface \\nof RBCs. A person having Rh factors has blood group.\\nRh-positive while a person not having Rh factors has blood group Rh-negative. Unlike the naturally \\noccurring anti-A & anti-B antibodies of the ABO-system, an Rh-negativeperson does not produce anti-Rh antibodies unless Rh-factor enters in his / her blood.32\\n9. Transport eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Blood transfusions in Rh blood group \\nsystem\\nRh-positive blood group can be transfused to \\nRh-positive recipient because recipient’s blood already has Rh-antigens and it will not produce anti-Rh antibody. Rh-negative blood group can be transfused to Rh-negative because donor’s blood does not have Rh-antigen and so recipient’s blood will not produce anti-Rh antibody. If an Rh-negative person receives Rh-positive blood, he / she will produce anti-Rh antibodies against Rh-factors. Rh-negative blood can be transfused to Rh-positive recipient, only if donor’s blood (Rh-negative) has never been exposed to Rh-antigens and does not contain any anti-Rh antibody.\\nPersons with blood group O are called universal donors. What is the actual universal donor blood group? Blood group O-positive or O-negative!O-negative blood group\\n9.2.2 HUMAN HEART \\nHeart is a muscular organ responsible for pumping blood through blood vessels by repeated contractions. The term “cardiac” means “related to the heart”. The bulk of the walls of heart chambers is made of cardiac muscles .\\nIn human body, heart is situated between lungs, in the middle of chest cavity (thorax) under breastbone.33\\n9. Transport eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Recalling\\nCardiac muscles are involuntary in action and are composed \\nof branched striated cells,each with a single nucleus.\\nHeart is enclosed in a sac known as pericardium . There is a fluid, known as pericardial fluid, \\nbetween pericardium and heart walls. It reduces friction between pericardium and heart, during heart contractions.\\nHuman heart consists of four chambers, like the heart of birds and other mammals. The upper \\nthin-walled chambers are called left and right atria (singular ‘atrium’), and the lower thick-walled \\nchambers are called left and right ventricles. Left ventricle is the largest and strongest chamber in heart.\\nThe heart is usually felt to be on the left side because the left chamber of the heart i.e. (left ventricle) is \\nstronger (it pumps blood to all body parts).\\nHuman heart works as a double pump. It receives deoxygenated (with less oxygen) blood from \\nbody and pumps it to lungs. At the same time, it receives oxygenated (with more oxygen) blood from lungs and pumps it to all body. Inside heart chambers, the deoxygenated and oxygenated bloods are kept separated. Here is a brief description of the circulation of blood inside heart to show its double-pump mechanism.34\\n9. Transport eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from body via the main veins i.e. superior and inferior \\nvena cavae. When right atrium contracts it passes the deoxygenated blood to right ventricle. The \\nopening between right atrium and right ventricle is guarded by a valve known as tricuspid valve \\n(because it has 3 flaps). When right ventricle contracts, the blood is passed to pulmonary trunk, which carries blood to lungs. Tricuspid valve prevents the backflow of blood from right ventricle to right atrium. At the base of pulmonary trunk, pulmonary semilunar valve is present which \\nprevents the backflow of blood from pulmonary trunk to right ventricle.\\nThe walls of left ventricle are the thickest one. These are about a half-inch thick. They have enough force \\nto push blood into the body. This gives an evidence that the structures of the parts of heart are adaptive \\nto their functions.\\nThe oxygenated blood from lungs is brought by pulmonary veins to left atrium. Left atrium \\ncontracts and pumps this blood to left ventricle. The opening between left atrium and left ventricle is guarded by a valve known as bicuspid valve (because it has two flaps). When left ventricle \\ncontracts, it pumps the oxygenated blood in aorta, which carries blood to all parts of body (except lungs). Bicuspid valve prevents the backflow of blood from left ventricle to left atrium. At the base of aorta, aortic semilunar  valve is present which prevents the backflow of blood from aorta to \\nleft ventricle (Figure 9.15).\\nAnimation 9.8 : Blood flow\\nSource & Credit: thomascsherman35\\n9. Transport eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1\\nFigure 9.15: Human heart; structure and blood flow\\nPulmonary and systemic circulation\\nWe see that right side of heart collects deoxygenated \\nblood from body and distributes it to lungs while left side collects oxygenated blood from lungs and distributes it to body. The pathway on which deoxygenated blood is carried from heart to lungs and in return oxygenated blood is carried from lungs to heart is called pulmonary \\ncirculation  or circuit  (Figure 9.16). Similarly, the pathway \\non which oxygenated blood is carried from heart to body tissues and in return deoxygenated blood is carried from body tissues to heart is called systemic circulation  or \\ncircuit.Both atria are filled simultaneously. They contract together to pump the blood to both the \\nventricles. Similarly, both ventricles contract simultaneously to pump the blood out of heart\\nThe blood in pulmonary circulation is at lower pressure than the blood in systemic circulation. It gives sufficient time to blood for gaseous exchange in lungs.36\\n9. Transport eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1\\nFigure 9.16: Double circuit circulation of blood37\\n9.

The alternating relaxations and contractions make up the cardiac cycle and one complete cardiac \\ncycle makes one heartbeat. Complete cardiac cycle consists of the following steps. Atria and ventricles relax and blood is filled in atria. This period is called cardiac diastole. \\nImmediately after their filling, both atria contract and pump blood towards ventricles. This period in cardiac cycle is called atrial \\nsystole. Now, both ventricles contract and pump blood towards body and lungs. \\nAnimation 9.9 : How Blood Flows Through the Heart\\nSource & Credit :  goldiesroom\\nAnimation 9.10 : The Whole Heart\\nSource & Credit :  Heart Point38\\n9.

In normal adults, the mass of heart is 250-350 g and the size is equal to a clenched fist.\\nThe period of ventricular \\ncontraction is called ventricular \\nsystole. In one heartbeat, diastole lasts about 0.4 seconds, atrial systole takes about 0.1 seconds, and ventricular systole lasts about 0.3 seconds (Figure 9.17). When ventricles contract, tricuspid and bicuspid valves close and “lubb” sound is produced. Similarly when ventricles relax, the semilunar valves close and “dubb” sound is produced. “Lubb-dubb” can be heard with the help of a stethoscope.\\nHeart rate and Pulse rate\\nHeart rate is the number of times the heart beats per minute. At rest or during normal activities, the normal heart rate is 70 times per minute in men and 75 times per minute in women. The heart rate fluctuates a lot depending on factors such as activity level and stress level.\\nFigure 9.17: One cardiac cycle39\\n9.

In adults, all arteries \\nwith the exception of the pulmonary arteries, carry oxygenated blood.\\nThe structure of arteries is well adapted to their function. The walls of an artery are composed \\nof three layers. The outermost layer is made of connective tissue. The middle one is made up of smooth muscles and elastic tissue while the innermost layer is made up of endothelial cells. The hollow internal cavity in which blood flows is called lumen.\\nWhen arteries enter body organs, they divide into smaller vessels known as arterioles. Arterioles \\nenter tissues and divide into capillaries.\\nCapillaries:  Capillaries are the smallest blood vessels present in tissues. These are formed by \\nthe divisions of arterioles. The exchange of materials between blood and tissue fluid is carried out through capillaries.\\nThe walls of capillaries are composed of only a single layer of cells i.e. endothelium. This layer is so \\nthin that molecules of the digested food, oxygen and water etc. can pass through them and enter tissue fluid. Waste products such as carbon dioxide and urea can diffuse from tissue fluid into blood.\\nCapillaries are so small that the red blood cells need to partially fold into bullet-like shapes in order to \\npass through them in single file.\\nVeins:  A vein is a blood vessel that carries blood towards heart. In adults, all veins with the exception \\nof pulmonary veins, carry deoxygenated blood.\\nVeins are also well-adapted to their function. The walls of vein are composed of the same three \\nlayers as are present in artery wall, with the difference that the middle layer of vein has less smooth muscles and elastic tissue as compared to artery. So the middle layer of vein is comparatively thin. The lumen of the veins is broader than that of arteries.\\nIn a tissue, capillaries join to form small venules, which join to form veins. Most veins have flaps \\ncalled valves that prevent the backflow of blood.42\\n9.

Draw the structure of capillary network seen in tail of fish.\\nThrough which blood vessels the materials are exchanged between the blood and the surrounding tissues?Capillaries\\n9.2.4 General Plan of  Human  Blood Circulatory System \\nMany scientists worked for discovering the facts about the circulation of blood in human body. Two important  scientists who revealed much knowledge of blood circulatory system were Ibn-e-\\nNafees  and William Harvey. Ibn-e-Nafees (1210-1286 AD) was a physician and he is honoured as the first   scientist who described the pathway of blood circulation. William Harvey (1578-1657 AD) discovered the pumping action of heart and the pathway of blood in major arteries and veins.\\nNow we will see how do the major arteries and veins make arterial and venous systems respectively.\\nArterial System\\nLarge pulmonary trunk  emerges from right ventricle and divides into right and left pulmonary \\narteries, which carry the deoxygenated blood to right and left lungs.\\nThe oxygenated blood leaving the left ventricle of heart is carried in a large artery i.e. aorta. It \\nascends and forms an aortic arch. The arch curves left and descends inferiorly into body. From \\nthe upper surface of aortic arch, three arteries emerge, which supply blood to head, shoulders and arms. As aorta passes down through thorax, it becomes dorsal aorta. It gives off many branches \\nand the important ones are listed here. Several intercostal arteries supply blood to ribs. Caeliac \\nartery and superior mesenteric artery supply blood to digestive tract while hepatic artery supplies \\nblood to liver. 45\\n9. Transport eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Even though the heart chambers are continually bathed with blood, this does not nourish heart \\nmuscles. The blood supply to heart muscles is provided by coronary arteries, which emerge from \\nthe base of aorta. Heart muscles are drained by coronary veins, which empty into right atrium. \\nCoronary arteries and veins are collectively called coronary circulation and it is a part of systemic \\ncirculation.\\nInferior to these, there are a pair of renal arteries that supply blood to kidneys. Gonadal arteries \\nsupply blood to gonads. Just below the gonadal arteries, is inferior mesenteric artery, which \\nsupplies blood to a part of the large intestine and rectum.Then aorta divides into two common \\niliac arteries, each of which divides into an internal iliac artery and an external iliac artery. Each \\nexternal iliac becomes femoral artery in upper thigh. It gives branches to thigh, knee, shank, ankle and foot.\\nVenous System\\nVeins from lungs, called pulmonary veins return the oxygenated blood to the left atrium of heart.\\nTwo major veins i.e. superior vena cava and inferior vena cava carry the deoxygenated blood \\nfrom rest of the body and empty into right atrium.\\nSuperior vena cava forms when different veins from head, shoulders and arms join together. From \\nlegs, the deoxygenated blood is returned to heart by many veins which empty into inferior vena cava. Veins carrying blood from calf, foot and knee join together to form femoral vein. It empties \\ninto external iliac vein which joins with the internal iliac  and both empty into common iliac vein. Animation 9.12: Blood Circulatory system\\nSource & Credit: my-ecoach46\\n9. Transport eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1\\nFigure 9.21: Major arteries and veins in human bodyRight and left common \\niliac veins join to form inferior vena cava. Many short veins empty into inferior vena cava. Among these are hepatic vein, renal veins, and gonadal veins. All veins coming from stomach,spleen, pancreas and intestine drain into hepatic portal vein, which carries blood to liver. From liver, a hepatic vein carries blood and empties into inferior vena cava. Two renal veins carry blood from kidneys while two gonadal veins carry blood from gonads to inferior vena cava. In thoracic cavity, inferior vena cava also receives veins from thoracic walls and ribs.\\nThrough which blood vessel the oxygenated blood leaves the human heart?Aorta47\\n9. Transport eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.19.3 CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS \\nThe diseases that involve the heart or blood vessels are collectively called cardiovascular disorders. \\nThese diseases have similar causes, mechanisms, and treatments.The risk factors that lead to cardiovascular disorders include advanced age, diabetes, high blood concentration of low density lipids (e.g. cholesterol) and triglycerides, tobacco smoking, high blood pressure (hypertension), obesity, and sedentary lifestyle.\\n9.3.1 ATHEROSCLEROSIS AND ARTERIOSCLEROSIS \\nAtherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis are the diseases of arteries. These diseases also lead to heart diseases. Atherosclerosis is commonly referred to as a “narrowing” of arteries. It is a chronic disease in which there is accumulation of fatty materials,cholesterol, or fibrin in arteries. When this condition is severe, arteries can no longer expand and contract properly, and blood moves through them with difficulty.\\nAccumulation of cholesterol is the prime contributor to atherosclerosis. It results in the formation \\nof multiple deposits called plaques within arteries. Plaques can form blood clots called thrombus within arteries. If a thrombus dislodges and becomes free floating,it is called an embolus.\\nArteriosclerosis is a general term describing any hardening of arteries. It occurs when calcium is deposited in the walls of arteries. It can happen when atherosclerosis is severe.\\nIt has been estimated that cardiovascular disorders are the major cause of sudden non-accidental deaths \\nin developed as well as developing countries.\\n9.3.2 MYOCARDIAL INF ARCTION \\nThe term myocardial infarction is derived from myocardium (the heart muscle) and infarction (tissue death). It is more commonly known as a heart attack. It occurs when blood supply to a part of heart is interrupted and leads the death of heart muscles. Heart attack may be caused by blood clot in48\\n9. Transport eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1coronary arteries. It is a medical emergency, and the leading cause of death for both men and \\nwomen all over the world. Severe chest pain is the most common symptom of myocardial infarction and may be in the form of sensation of tightness, pressure, or squeezing. Pain radiates most often to left arm, but may also radiate to lower jaw, neck, right arm and back. Loss of consciousness and even sudden death can occur in myocardial infarction.\\nApproximately one fourth of all myocardial infarctions are silent i.e. without chest pain \\nor other symptoms. A silent heart attack is more common in the elderly, in patients with \\ndiabetes mellitus and after heart transplantation.\\nFigure 9.22: Atherosclerosis and resulting Myocardial infarction49\\n9. Transport eLearn.Punjab\\nV: 1.1Immediate treatment for suspected acute myocardial infarction includes oxygen supply,aspirin, \\nand sublingual tablet of glyceryl trinitrate. Most cases of myocardial infarction are treated with  \\nangioplasty (mechanical widening of a narrowed or totally obstructed blood vessel) or bypass \\nsurgery (surgery in which arteries or veins from elsewhere in the patient’s body are grafted to the coronary arteries to improve blood supply to heart muscles).\\nAngina pectoris means “chest pain”. It is not as severe as heart attack. The pain may occur in heart and often in left arm and shoulder. It is a warning sign that blood supply to heart muscles is not sufficient but shortage is not enough to cause tissue death.World Heart Day is held on 28th September every year throughout the world. Its objective is to help people better understand their personal risks of cardiovascular disorders.\\nCardiovascular disorders are the cause of 12% of adult deaths in Pakistan (Source: Federal Bureau of Statistics of Pakistan). Hypertension (blood pressure higher than normal) is the most common cause of cardiovascular disorders in Pakistan.•\\n There are over 12 million hypertension patients in Pakistan.\\n•\\n About 10% of our population is diabetic.\\n•\\n According to the World Health Organization,in Pakistan 1 in 7 urban adults is obese.50\\n9.
